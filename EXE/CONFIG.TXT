For those user who wish to semi-permanently modify the default
characteristics of PolyMake the following procedure will suffice.
Note that the addresses given apply ONLY to PolyMake V2.1, other
versions will probably not have their configuration information at
the same addresses.

IMPORTANT!  Do not attempt to modify the configuration data in your
            distribution copy of PolyMake.  Always modify a
            copy of your distribution disk.  That way, if something
            goes wrong you will have the original to go back to.

CAUTION!    Polytron Corp. is providing the following information as
            a service to the advanced user.  The information herein
            is correct and, when followed EXACTLY, will not impair
            the functionality of the PolyMake version for which

   DEBUG X

Step 3. Examine and change the configuration parameters of interest.

   The following configuration parameters occupy two bytes of memory
   beginning at the given address.  Both addresses and values are
   given in hexadecimal with respect to the value contained in DS
   when debug loads the file.
