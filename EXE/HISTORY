                     Polytron Version Control System
                        Corporate/Network Version

This version of PVCS contains fixes for some bugs that were present in
previous versions as well as enhancements as noted below.  Some of the
revision numbers below are internal releases only.

X031  (14 Dec 1987)

Corrections

- Fixed a bug in VDIFF that sometimes caused a divide overflow.

Enhancements

- Added an alias capability similar to that in the screen interface.
  See the PVCS manual supplement for details.

- Added the ability to remove special meaning from quote and apostrophe
  characters in command files.  To do so, simply place a backslash
  immediately preceding the quote or apostrophe.

X030  (14 Oct 1987)

Corrections

- Made VDIFF resynchronize correctly with context set to zero.
- Fixed a problem in VMRG where certain sequences at the end of the
  files were not being handled correctly.
  
Enhancements

- Logfiles have an additional attribute [NO]TRANSLATE; see the manual
  supplement for details.

- The -Q option on all commands now has a modifier that removes the
  implicit affirmative response characteristic.  -QO indicates that
  Quite Only is requested, ie., not implicit affirmation also.  Note
  that -QO -Y is identical to -Q.

- The revision delete capability has been removed from the VCS command.
  A new command, VDEL, provides this function.  See the manual supplement
  for details.

- Keyword expansion is now an attribute of a logfile rather than a
  runtime option.  This change was necessary for compatibility with
  non-text files and other files for which keyword expansion is always
  not desired.  See the manual supplement for details.

- Added the concept of branch versions.  See the manual supplement
  for details.

- Added a test when revision is PUT, to see if the timestamp of the file
  being put is later than its prospective parent in the logfile.  If not,
  the user is queried about whether or not to continue.  The -Q, -N, and
  -Y options provide implied responses to this query in the normal fashion.

- A new configuration parameter controls whether or not a new logfile will
  be created if the PUT command cannot find a corresponding logfile.  The
  two variations are AUTOCREATE and NOAUTOCREATE with the former being the
  default.
  
- A message file capability has been added to allow descriptions associated
  with the -T and -M options of the PUT and the -T option of the VCS command.
  See the mannual supplement for details.

- Arguments to PVCS commands may now be quoted with either the single
  quote (') or double quote (") character.  The quoted string may
  directly include the quote character not used to quote the string and
  the quote character used may be used literally by escaping it with
  a backslash.  Some examples will clarify this.

    PUT -M"this string contains a single quote ' at this point"
    PUT -M'this string contains a double quote " at this point'
    PUT -M"this string contains both quotes '\" at this point"
    
- A new keyword, Workfile, has been added that expands to the name
  of the workfile.  As usual, this keyword is case sensitive and must
  be surrounded by dollar signs.

- A new configuration parameter, NEWLINE, has been added to specify the
  character string to be used for the newline sequence when expanding
  the $Log keyword.  See the manual supplement for details.

- A single logical configuration file line may be continued over multiple
  physical by ending all but the last physical line with a backslash.

X029  (04 Aug 1987)

Enhancements

- Added the hooks to allow cooperation with the screen interface.

X028  (20 Jul 1987)

Enhancements

- Two new brief reporting modes were added to the VLOG command.

    -BN[<branch>]
    -BR[<rev/branch>]

  See the manual supplement for details.

- A version renaming feature has been added to the VCS command.

    -V<new version>::<old version>

  causes the old version to be changed to the new version name.

Corrections

- Certain unusual cases (eg. files containing no unique lines) were
  able to fool PUT into thinking that more of the file had been changed
  than actually had.  The only effect of this was that the logfile size
  grew more rapidly than it otherwise should have.

- Disk-full conditions were not always being detected when GETting the
  latest revision.

- Date ranges beginning with an asterisk were not being handled correctly.

- COMMENTPREFIX configuration parameters required whitespace following the
  extension.

V1.4a (28 May 1987)
X027  (28 May 1987)

- See the READ.ME file for latest details.  All information in this
  file has been incorporated in the new release of the manual; all
  references to the READ.ME file beyond this point should be redirected
  to the manual.

X026 (28 Apr 1987)

Corrections

- VMRG sometimes got confused if a series of non-unique matching lines
  were isolated by non-matching lines at the beginning or end of files.
  
- Deleting a trunk tip revision caused branch revisions added after the
  successor trunk tip revision to be invisible.
  
- Specifying a major number only on a PUT command when the major number
  already existed caused an error to be reported rather than just using
  the next available minor number.


V1.4 (20 Apr 1987)
X025 (20 Apr 1987)

Enhancements

- Added a new configuration parameter EXCLUSIVELOCK.  When used, this
  parameter prevents the locking of more than one revision in a given
  logfile.  The default is NOEXCLUSIVELOCK.

Corrections

- When the WRITEPROTECT status of a logfile was changed, the actual
  attributes of the file were not being changed.

- Very large journal files caused an "Insufficient memory" error message.


X023 (25 Mar 1987)

Enhancements

- Added a modifier to the -F option to force creation of a branch.
  Example:

  PUT -FB *.c

  This causes branch creation even if the locked revision is a tip revision.
  The -FB and -R options are mutually exclusive.

- Added the @<file> capability to the IDENT, REGEN, and VJOURNAL commands.

- Added a -H option to GET, IDENT, PUT, REGEN, VCS, VDIFF, VJOURNAL,
  VLOG, and VMRG commands to display helpful text.

- The forward slash was an undocumented synonym for dash, ie. it could
  be used as an option escape character.  This use was removed thus
  allowing forward slash to be used as the first character of filenames.
  
Corrections

- The FORCEUNLOCK parameter sometimes caused unexpected characters to
  be inserted in the journal file.

- A VDIFF command using an unadorned logfile name was not being processed
  correctly.
  

V1.3 (04 Mar 1987)
X022 (25 Feb 1987)

Enhancements

- The -Q flag suppresses warning messages.


X021 (17 Feb 1987)

Enhancements

- The GET, PUT, and VCS commands now have a -Y option that gives an
  implicit affirmative response to any and all questions that would
  normally be asked by those commands.  In this respect, the -Y option
  performs the same function as the -Q option but of course -Q suppresses
  some informative output.  Note that if both -N and -Y are given, -N
  takes precedence in the same manner that -N overrides the affirmative
  response characteristics of -Q.
  
- The GET and VCS commands no longer allow a lock to be placed on a
  revision in a logfile that does not have lock checking enabled.
  

X020 (09 Feb 1987)

Corrections

- It was possible for the VCS command to lock a revision that was already
  locked.

Enhancements

- The SCREEN configuration parameter (introduced in X019 - see the README
  file) now accepts a HERCULES modifier to indicate that a Hercules-compatible
  display card is in use.  The only difference is how the cursor looks; PVCS
  will function with Hercules cards even without the HERCULES modifier.
  Example:

     SCREEN HERCULES

- When using your own editor to compose change descriptions and workfile
  descriptions, PVCS now includes a second line indicating the file involved.
  If both information lines are unchanged, both will be automatically removed
  from the response.  If either line is modified, neither will be removed.

- When doing a PUT or VCS -I operation with the -Q flag, the filename(s) of
  the effected files will also be output.
  
Notes

- PolyShell users will notice that they have two CHMOD commands - one in
  PVCS and one in PolyShell.  Unfortunately, the W attribute is interepreted
  as WRITE-PROTECT in the former and WRITABLE in the latter.  You should
  choose which command you wish to use and delete the other from your system.
  For purposes of uniformity, it is advisable to use the PolyShell version.
  

X019 (19 Jan 1987)

Enhancements

- Several new configuration parameters have been added; see the README
  file for details.
  
Corrections

- Added code to VDIFF to display ctrl-Z as ^Z to avoid prematurely
  terminating the display.  Also fixed a bug that caused VDIFF to think
  two files were the same if lines were simply moved around.
  
- Made the CHMOD command accept filenames beginning with dot.

- Fixed a bug in the version labelling logic that caused an error to
  be reported in certain cases where an explicit revision number was given.
  
- A bug was fixed in the GET command that sometimes caused two revisions
  to be copied to standard output when the -p option was used.

- Certain error messages were classified as INTERNAL, and therefore were
  not completely displayed, when they should have not been.

- A bug was fixed in the logic that compares revision numbers that caused
  PVCS commands to get confused when the minor part of a revision number
  became very large.
  

V1.2a (08 Dec 1986)
X018 (20 Nov 1986)
