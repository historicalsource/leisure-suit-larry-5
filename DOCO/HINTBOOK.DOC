Introduction

Welcome back to the world of Passionate Patti and Larry; Larry Laffer!

We hope you'll have as much fun playing this game as we had creating it.  With any luck, you'll have a lot more fun playing it than we had creating it.  LEISURE SUIT LARRY 5: PASSIONATE PATTI DOES A LITTLE UNDERCOVER WORK took over 300 person-years to create, and uses nearly 4,000 full-sized hand-painted drawings and 1,200,000 lines of code.  All this to deliver, say, a dozen jokes.  Worth it?  You tell me.

Before you plunge into this book and wreck the whole discovery experience we were shooting for, take the time to read the Sierra Game Manual thoroughly.  You may find that some of the questions you have about how the game works are answered in that manual.

How To Use This Hintbook

In LEISURE SUIT LARRY 5, both Larry and Patti do a lot of traveling.  The cities and locations can be visited in any order at all: Larry can go to Miami first, or Atlantic City, or the Big Apple.  Patti has two locations to investigate; it's up to you to decide where to go to first.  So we've organized this hintbook into two general parts (Larry and Patti).  In those parts, we've then subdivided the parts by location.  Using the Table of Contents will allow you to jump to the part of the Hintbook that
deals with your current situation.

Once you find a question that deals with your problem, place your "Adventure Window" card over the hints to reveal them one by one. Be careful how much of the hint you read.  The first answer is the mildest hint, something that just steers you in the right direction... or, if I feel like it, a wisecrack (that may or may be instructive).  The second answer is a little more specific. The third and any following answers will be very specific, often giving you the exact clicks you need to solve the puzzle.  
East and west refer to the right and left sides of your screen, respectively.  Consult the maps at the end of the hintbook if you need to.

How NOT to Use This Hintbook!

You should avoid reading those sections of the book that give hints for locations you haven't played yet (or plan to revisit)! Reading questions that don't pertain to the part of the game you're playing may reveal information you don't need or want yet. Read only the hints you're sure you need.  There are a few "red herring" questions thrown in here and there just to keep you on your toes.


When You've Solved the Game

Once you've finished the game, turn to the back of the book and look at Section 12 and beyond to the point lists and item lists. Those sections will give you ways to increase your score, or just provide some extra laughs you didn't know were in there!  Since you can finish the game with only a couple hundred points out of a possible thousand, there's probably at least a few things you may have missed.

Thanks again for purchasing LEISURE SUIT LARRY 5.  I hope you're enjoying it, and that this hintbook increases that enjoyment!  If you enjoyed LSL5, be sure to check out Larry's previous adventures and Sierra's other 3-D animated adventure games.  And keep those cards and letters "coming!"

General Questions

Q.	Which is higher in rank, a Brigadier General or a Major General?

A.	Who wants to know?

A.	In order of descending importance: General, Lieutenant General, Major General, Brigadier General.  Does that answer your question?

Q.	I'm just wandering around aimlessly.  What am I supposed to do?

A.	Watch the opening cartoon.  Your boss, Mr. Silas Scruemall, will tell you what you're supposed to do.

A.	Once you've watched the opening cartoon, your goal is to get everything you'll need to hold the final auditions for the Sexiest Woman In America to host Mr. Scruemall's latest blockbuster-to-be.

A.	Explore the offices of PornProdCorp carefully!  You'll need three degaussed videotapes, your camera, a battery charger, resumes for the three finalists, and an AeroDork Gold Card. You may also want to charge your camera up!  You can do all this before leaving PornProdCorp.

Q.	The manual tells me there's supposed to be a bunch of icons at the top of the screen.  I don't see anything of the sort. Have I got bad disks?

A.	Nope.  Do you have a "Sierra Game Manual?"  If so, READ IT! It'll come in handy to answer questions just like these.

A.	If you have a mouse, simply move the cursor up to the very top of the screen, and the icon bar will appear almost instantaneously.  If you have a joystick, Button #2 should open the icon bar.  Or just hit the ESC key to bring up the icons!

Q.	What are these icons all about, anyway?

A.	The icons are your guide to the world of Larry; Larry Laffer (and Passionate Patti)!  Read the "Sierra Game Manual" to find out what most of them do.

A.	To find out what the icons are, click on or select the Question Mark at the right end of the icon bar.  Now move the question mark over the other icons and you'll get convenient little windows telling you what each icon does.

A.	You're SO lazy!  From left to right, the icons are: Walk, Look, Use, Talk, Zipper, Fast Forward, Current inventory window, Inventory, Control Panel, and that question mark you're so reluctant to use.

Q.	I've never seen this "Fast Forward" thing before.  What does it do?

A.	Obviously, it lets you fast forward.

A.	You can only fast forward through non-interactive portions of the game.  You have to play through the interactive portions!

Q.	What's the zipper for?

A.	Try it and see.

A.	What's a zipper USUALLY for?

A.	If you're unzipping, you're either trying to remove your clothes or show somebody you mean BUSINESS...and I don't mean business.

Q.	How do I know what I've got in my inventory?

A.	Select the INVENTORY icon (it looks like a briefcase).  A window will open up with all your inventory objects!  To select one, click on the arrow and click the arrow on the object.  To look at or manipulate an inventory object, choose either the eye icon or the hand icon (along the top of the inventory window).

Q.	How do I use something I've got in my inventory?

A.	Read the manual!

A.	To use something from your inventory, first click on the Inventory Icon on the main Icon bar.  The Inventory window will show up.  One of the Inventory window icons at the top (next to the hand) is an arrow.  Select the arrow, then click that arrow on the item you want to use.  The arrow will change to a cursor representing that item.  Click on the OK button to close the Inventory window and get back to the game!

Q.	How do I save my game?

A.	This game is beyond saving!

A.	But should you wish to try anyway, simply click on the Control icon to bring up the Control Panel.  Select SAVE and type the name of the game you wish to save.  If you want to delete a saved game (which you may need to do if you've filled up the directory with your past saves) or save to a different directory, push the appropriate button.

Q.	Where can I see how many points I've accumulated?

A.	You mean you haven't been keeping track?

A.	To make things easier on you (always our goal here at Sierra On-Line), we've automatically enabled an onscreen scorekeeper.  Simply click on the Control Panel icon to see how many points you've got so far.  Collect the whole set!

Q.	One THOUSAND points?  You must be yanking my chain.

A.	I wouldn't go anywhere NEAR your chain.

A.	Yes, one THOUSAND points.  If it's good enough for Mr.  Bush's points of light, it's good enough for me.

Q.	Everything goes way too slowly.  Can I speed up the process here?

A.	Why, certainly!

A.	You could read the Sierra Game Manual to find out how.

A.	But if you'd prefer to read it here, do this: Open the control panel and move the speed slider UP to make the animation go faster.  Also, turning down the detail level will make the game go faster still, but you may miss out on some really priceless animation and special effects!  Then you may not.

Q.	Everything goes way too quickly.  Can I slow down the animation?

A.	Make up your mind.  A moment ago, everything was going too slowly.

A.	Open up the control panel by selecting the Control icon. Move the speed slider down.  Also, the higher the detail slider, the slower the game will go (on machines that are deficient in raw computing power)!  

Q.	The text windows go by too quickly (or too slowly).  Fix it, now.

A.	Impatient, aren't you?

A.	On the control panel, there's a slider that says, "Text." Slide it up and the text goes by faster.  Slide it down and the text goes by slower.  When you're finished reading a text box, you can usually get rid of it and move on by pressing the ENTER button, left-clicking with the mouse, or hitting your joystick's fire button.

Q.	I'm tired of these opening credits.

A.	Too bad.  We worked damn hard on this game and you're going to jolly well see who's responsible.

A.	Oh, all right.  Click on the left button or hit [ENTER]. You'll be shown the Fast Forward button.  Hit the button that sez, "Really?  Show Me!" and you'll be shown where the Fast Forward button actually appears in the icon bar.  Hit the Fast Forward button up there and confirm your choice. You'll skip to the beginning of the game.

Q.	I've already seen this opening cartoon.  Must I sit through it over and over again?  Have mercy!

A.	There are nuances in this opening cartoon which you'll surely miss out on if you skip it.  Also, the plot, such as it is, is explained in a kind of convoluted way.  I advise you to watch it over and over until you've memorized it and can recite it from memory.

A.	If you're SURE you want to skip it, bring up the icon bar either with the ESC key or by moving the cursor to the top of the screen.  Hit the Fast Forward button up there, confirm your choice and you'll skip to the beginning of the game.

Q.	I'm tired of playing Larry (or Patti)!  How can I switch to the other character?

A.	That's for me to know and you to find out.

A.	The game will automatically switch you back and forth between Larry and Patti when the time comes.  You may have to play as Larry for awhile to get to Patti's parts (and isn't that what we all want)?

A.	In general, if you're playing Larry, you'll switch to Patti whenever you board a plane.  If you're playing Patti, you'll switch to Larry whenever you take a limo ride.


LARRY'S PARTS

1. At PornProdCorp

Q.	I was idly watching the opening cartoon when suddenly I (as Larry) am now suddenly standing outside the meeting room door, and somebody's yelling for coffee.  What do you suggest?

A.	If you just stand there for awhile, clicking aimlessly (or not at all), a little mini-tutorial will pop up and show you exactly what to do.

A.	Get coffee, why dontcha?

A.	Click the HAND icon on the coffee pot next to the door!

Q.	I've left the meeting, and am standing around the lobby of PornProdCorp.  What am I looking for?

A.	Did you pay attention to what Silas told you to do?

A.	Have you explored PornProdCorp thoroughly?

A.	First, find some videotapes and make sure they'll work in your Pocket Protector Camera.  Then charge it up, get the resumes for your three "interviewees," and get something so you can travel cross-country without cash.

Q.	Every time I get somewhere, I stop and reminisce about the end of Leisure Suit Larry 3.  What's going on?

A.	You're trying to remember how you got where you are now!

A.	There's a big, empty hole in your memory, Larry, and you're trying to fill in the pieces.

A.	Think hard enough, and you might remember everything that in LEISURE SUIT LARRY 4: THE MISSING FLOPPIES.

A.	Then again, probably not.

Q.	There are piles of videotapes everywhere, but none that seem to be of any use to me.

A.	Look carefully; there are three videotapes in the Tape Room you can use.

A.	Look down next to the monitor in the lower right corner of the room.

A.	Click the HAND icon on the pile of three videotapes sitting on the table just left of the monitor in the lower right- hand corner of the room.

Q.	Why won't the videotapes work in my "Rob Lowe" camera?

A.	The "Rob Lowe," being a marvel of miniaturization, won't erase tapes.  You have to erase the videotapes first.

A.	There's a device in the tape room that can erase (or "degauss") the tapes first.

A.	Click each tape, one at a time, on the degausser on the table along the back wall of the Tape Room (all the way on the right side of the table).  Now they should work with your camera!

Q.	Hey, now see here!  When I look at my camera, it tells me it's not charged.  How do I go about changing that?

A.	Get a new camera.  (Just kidding)

A.	All right, here's a shorter-term solution.  Get a battery charger.  

A.	Go into the Tape Room and click the HAND icon on the drawer all the way on the right.

Q.	Great, now I've got a camera and a device to charge the battery.  What do I hafta do to get the thing charged up?

A.	Find an outlet (and I don't mean Primal Scream Therapy)!

A.	There's an outlet on the wall by the coffee maker at PornProdCorp, and there are also outlets in every airport, on the east wall.

A.	Select the BATTERY CHARGER from inventory and click it on any outlet to plug it in.  Then select the CAMERA from inventory and click it on the battery charger!  It only takes a minute to charge the camera's battery.  Use the EYE icon to see when the camera is at 100% power.  When it is, click the HAND on the camera to unplug it and retrieve both the camera and the charger.

Q.	I'm ready to leave PornProdCorp, I think!  Trouble is, there doesn't seem to be anywhere to go.

A.	Have you found the outside of the building, east of the lobby where you started?

A.	Have you found the three resumes of the finalists, in the first file cabinet on your right in the file room?  Have you found your AeroDork Gold Card, sitting in the imprinter on the table in the File Room?

A.	If you've found the resumes and the AeroDork Gold Card, a limo will be awaiting you outside the building.  Click your hand on the limo's door to enter it.  And hey, I hope you degaussed your videotapes first...and brought along a battery charger!


2. In The Limo

Q.	When are we going to get to the airport?

A.	We'll be there when we get there.

A.	We're almost there.  Why don't you play a car game?

A.	You'll arrive automatically if you'll just be patient and sit through a cartoon or two.

Q.	Nothing seems to work in this limo.

A.	That's not a question.

Q.	Does anything work in here?

A.	That's better, that's something I can work with.

A.	No, at least not in this part of the game.

A.	Not if you're Larry.  Look under Patti's Parts (and wouldn't you like to do just that!) if you're Patti and you're in the limousine.

Q.	Is there anything I can find in here?

A.	Yes, but only once, and only in one city.

A.	Keep your eyes open.  You may eventually find something on the seat next to you, if you're observant.

A.	When you're in New York, you'll be able to find a Day Trotter on the seat next to you as you ride to the Hard Disk Cafe.

Q.	How do I tell the driver where to take me?

A.	If you're going to the airport, you won't need to.  The driver knows you're going to the airport.

A.	Your object is to track down these girls at their familiar locations, right?  How would you know where to find them?

A.	Look in their resumes!

A.	Open your inventory window.  Click the inventory EYE icon on each of the three resumes.  You'll find a matchbook, a napkin and a business card.  Select the proper item with the ARROW icon, then click the item on the driver.  The driver will take you to the address on the item...IF the item matches the city you're in, naturally!3. Airports and Airplanes

Q.	Huzzah...I've made it to an airport!  Now I'm getting somewhere!

A.	Well, good for you!

A.	It's nice to see you're so proud of yourself.

A.	You've hardly begun.  You've still got lots to do.  Don't get overconfident. 

Q.	Can I go anywhere from this curb outside the airport?

A.	What kind of game would it be if you couldn't?

A.	You can go into the airport...AND...

A.	...you can access the Automatic Ticket Machine (ATM) to the left of the airport doorway.

A.	You can't go to any of the other entrances...the luggage is permanently blocking your way, since the Skycaps are all on strike!

Q.	I'm at the ATM Machine.  What can I do here?

A.	For starters, you can stop calling it an ATM Machine.  ATM stands for "Automatic Ticket Machine," so it's redundant to call it an "Automatic Ticket Machine Machine."

A.	You can get a ticket here!

A.	Click the HAND on the ATM to get a closeup of it.  Select the AeroDork Gold Card from your inventory and click it on the slot to the left of the ATM screen.  When the destinations appear, click the HAND on whichever destination you want.  Punch in the proper code from the AeroDork Travel Folder that came in your game box.  When the Boarding Pass emerges, click the HAND on it to take it, then on the AeroDork card when it pops out of the slot.

Q.	How do I know which destination to select first?

A.	You don't!

A.	There's no way to tell in advance which destination to select first.

A.	That's because it doesn't matter at all.  You can go to any of the cities in any order you wish.

Q.	The ATM ate my AeroDork card!  Looks like I'm hopelessly stuck now!

A.	No, but you're hopelessly lazy!

A.	You've read a hint for a problem that hasn't come up yet.

A.	Mostly because the ATM never eats your AeroDork card.  Stop reading hints for nonexistent problems!

Q.	I'm in the Airport Terminal, but I can't find a gate or a plane!

A.	You'll want to be a member of the Chartreuse Carpet VIP Club.

A.	Any AeroDork Gold Cardmember qualifies!  All you have to do is demonstrate proof of cardmemberholdingship!

A.	Select the Gold Card from your inventory and click the Gold Card on the camera right outside the VIP Lounge door!

Q.	When is my plane going to board?

A.	Be patient.

A.	Sit down.

A.	Sooner or later.  Just make sure you've got your boarding pass and you're in the VIP lounge.

Q.	Once the plane is officially boarding, how do I get onboard?

A.	You'll need your boarding pass.

A.	You'll need to be in the VIP Lounge.

A.	Click the boarding pass on the slot next to the door.

Q.	I'd like some transportation outta this airport!

A.	You can probably call for a limo, if you've found a telephone number.

A.	Say!  If you look at all those large display ads at the top of the airport terminal screens, you'll find one with a limousine phone number.  

A.	Now all you have to do is find some change and a working phone.

Q.	Is there anything I can do onboard the plane?

A.	You can dream, can't you?

A.	You might want to snag that magazine in the seat pocket in front of you.  It may contain articles of a useful or informative nature!

Q.	Say, those gals behind the desk are CUTE!  

A.	Yes, aren't they?

A.	You can't do anything with them, though.  

A.	If you want to see something thrilling, stay in the center screen and walk up close to the counter where they're working and wait until they've both moved offscreen to the right.  Go to the right and you'll see how they really feel about each other!

Q.	I'm done with my three interviews, but I don't know where to go to next.

A.	Back where you came from!

A.	Back to PornProdCorp!

A.	When you're done with New York, Atlantic City, and Miami (not necessarily in that order), go back to the airport and get a ticket to Los Angeles.  That's where you started from!

Q.	The plane is going to crash!

A.	<Insert your own smartass comment here!>

A.	Maybe you can help!  (Not help the plane CRASH, help it NOT crash!)

A.	When the stewardess calls for volunteers, you'll automatically be led to the cockpit.  Start clicking your Hand Icon on various dials and controls, and sooner or later, you'll probably find one that'll do some good!



4. In New York

Q.	How in the world do I get out of LaGuardia?

A.	Visitors to New York City have been asking that question for years.

A.	See the question in Section 2 about getting transportation out of the airport.

A.	One of the large ads at the top of the screen will have a phone number you can call to get a limo.

Q.	Is there anything I need to do before I leave this airport?

A.	Maybe.

A.	Is your camera charged up?  

A.	If not, use the outlet on the far west wall of the terminal. To do that: select the battery charger from your inventory, click it on the outlet, then select your camera from inventory and click it on the plugged-in battery charger. Wait one minute before clicking the hand icon on the camera to unplug it all.

Q.	Got any spare change, man?

A.	No, and don't bother me.

A.	But maybe you can get some from Jerry's Kids.

A.	See the collection canister by the VIP Lounge door?  Click the Hand Icon on the canister to get a quarter.  That should be all you need!

Q.	All the phones here are broken!

A.	Welcome to New York City!

A.	Surely one of them is working!

A.	Click the Hand Icon on each of the telephones on the East side of the terminal.  One of them will work.

Q.	Where do I tell the limo driver to take me?

A.	She can't hear you, so you can't tell her anything.

A.	But you can show her!  See the hint in Section 2 about communicating with the limo driver.

A.	Select the Napkin from your inventory (it's in Michelle's resume; take it out by clicking the EYE on her resume). Click the Napkin on your Limo driver and you're on your way!

Q.	I'm in the Hard Disk Cafe, but I'm not a member, so I can't get past the Maitre D'...or can I?

A.	Yes, you can!

A.	Talk to him.

A.	Talk to him a LOT.

A.	Keep talking to him.  Sooner or later, he'll give in and punch you up your own membership tape!

Q.	Michelle went into the exclusive Herman Hollerith room, but my membership tape isn't authorized to let me in there!

A.	Maybe you can adjust the information on your tape a bit.

A.	Look around, there may be a way to punch a few new holes into your tape.

A.	In the lobby, you'll find a music box.  Select your Membership Tape from inventory and click it on the Music Box.  Voila!  Instant Superuser Status!  Go get her, Larry!

Q.	Michelle is sitting just a few feet away from me!  What should I do?  What should I say?  I'm so nervous!

A.	Try an opening line.

A.	Try a few more.

A.	Click the TALK icon on Michelle a few times.  Eventually, she'll invite you over for a more intimate conversation!

Q.	I can't seem to get anything going with Michelle.  Any tips?

A.	You DID find the Day Trotter in the limousine on the way to the Cafe, didn't you?

A.	Did you look inside the Day Trotter?

A.	Give Michelle the Day Trotter by selecting it from inventory and clicking it on her.

A.	Give Michelle the credit cards you found inside the Day Trotter.

A.	Give Michelle the cash you found inside the Day Trotter. Then sit back and relax!  Oh, by the way...did you remember to turn on the camera before she "mouthed off" to you?

Q.	I didn't get our little lunch session on videotape.  What did I do wrong?

A.	Maybe the battery wasn't charged?  If not, you should have charged it up at LaGuardia, with the outlet all the way on the west side of the terminal.

A.	Maybe the tapes weren't degaussed?  You should have degaussed all three back at PornProdCorp.  If you didn't, you blew it big time!

A.	Maybe you forgot to put a tape into the camera?

A.	Maybe you simply neglected to turn the camera on.  You should turn it on sometime during your conversation, before she makes the booth "a little more private!"

Q.	How do I get back to LaGuardia when I'm done at the Hard Disk Cafe?

A.	Call the limousine!

A.	Use the phone that Bertha, the gabby woman, was using when you first entered the cafe...she's done with it now.

A.	I hope you wrote down the number of the limo service that you got from the ad at LaGuardia!  They're the ones who can drive you back to the airport.

Q.	I'm all through with the Hard Disk Cafe, but Bertha won't let me make a call.

A.	Then you're not really done at the Cafe, are you?

A.	You haven't met Michelle Milken.

A.	Read the hints about getting past the Maitre D' and getting into the Herman Hollerith room!



5. In Atlantic City

Q.	I'd like to see more of Atlantic City than just the airport.

A.	See the question in Section 2 about getting transportation out of the airport.

A.	Keep looking up and something will occur to you.

A.	One of the large ads at the top of the screen will have a phone number you can call to get the Tramp Limo to escort you.

Q.	Getting ahold of the Tramp Limousine will require me to make a call.  But I'm broke!

A.	Nobody's broke for too long in Atlantic City!

A.	Have you looked on the west side of the terminal?

A.	Click the Hand Icon on the slot machine second from the left.  

Q.	How am I supposed to call a limousine when all the phones are broken?

A.	Who told you all the phones are broken?

A.	They were wrong.  

A.	Click the Hand Icon on each phone.  One of them will work!

Q.	Is there anything I need to do before I leave this airport?

A.	Maybe.

A.	Is your camera charged up?  

A.	If not, use the outlet on the far west wall of the terminal. To do that: select the battery charger from your inventory, click it on the outlet, then select your camera from inventory and click it on the plugged-in battery charger. Wait one minute before clicking the hand icon on the camera to unplug it all.

Q.	How do I get to wherever it is I'm supposed to be going?

A.	Once you're in the limousine, it's easy.  You're supposed to go to the fabulous Tramp Casino.

A.	See the hint in Section 2 about communicating with the limousine drivers.  Select the Matchbook from your inventory (it's in Lana's resume; take it out by clicking the EYE on her resume). Click the Matchbook on your Limo driver and you're on your way.

Q.	I'd love to do some gambling at the Tramp Casino, but I don't have a penny to my name!

A.	Like many casinos, they'll be more than happy to start you off with a little playing money!

A.	All you have to do is find the right person to talk to.

A.	Speak to the woman standing right outside the Tramp Casino entrance.  She'll play a little guessing game with you.

A.	Once you guess her number (she'll make it terribly easy), you can head on in and parlay those few Tramp coins into a boodle!

Q.	Can I can play any of these games?

A.	Of course you can.  This isn't Leisure Suit Larry 3!  We wouldn't tease you.

A.	Click the Hand Icon on any of the unoccupied machines.

Q.	I'm not doing too well at this video poker.  Wanna tell me the secret?

A.	Not really, because once you know, the whole neighborhood is going to find out.

A.	You have to play the video poker game, but you don't have to play it fair.  This is a computer game; you can use that fact to cheat a little bit.

A.	All right, you talked me into it.  Every time you win a few bucks, you should go up to the Control Icon and SAVE YOUR GAME.  That way, if you lose the next couple of hands, you can restore and start with all your money again.  Of course, you could never legally get away with this at a real casino!

Q.	I may have to restore to an earlier game, right?  I've gambled away all my money, and now I'm penniless at Tramp Casino!  

A.	Only temporarily.

A.	You can get some more Tramp coins and keep gambling, y'know! You don't have to restore.

A.	Go back to the bimbo out in front of the Casino and play her guessing game again.  Anytime you're broke, you can go back to her for another guessing game!

Q.	Gee whiz, Al, this Video Poker game is great!  I could play all night!  Should I?

A.	Sure, knock yourself out.

A.	On the other hand, should you want to get on with the game, it would be safe to stop at about 750 bucks in Tramp coins.

A.	You can even get by with only 500 bucks in Tramp coins, but you'll have to be clever to do everything you need to do in Atlantic City with only $500.

Q.	How long is this Boardwalk?

A.	It's only about 20 feet long, but it's hundreds of thousands of feet wide.

A.	Yeah, I use this same joke later on in the game.  Stay tuned!

Q.	Am I supposed to try to rescue the volleyball player?

A.	Yes.

A.	But only if she looks like she's drowning.

A.	And only if you're playing CODENAME: ICEMAN instead of LEISURE SUIT LARRY 5.

Q.	Is there anything I need on the Boardwalk?

A.	No, but there's something you need in one of the STORES on the Boardwalk!

A.	Walk far enough down the Boardwalk and you'll come to Ivana's Skates, Inc.  Head on in.

A.	You'll want to rent a pair of rollerblades, which will cost you about $250 in Tramp money.

Q.	I know Lana's around here somewhere, but I just can't find her!

A.	She can usually be found skating somewhere on the Boardwalk.

A.	If you want to find her, you should rent some skates at Ivana's.  See the question about what you might need on the Boardwalk.  Rent a pair of skates and put them on.  Skate back to the Casino and all around the Boardwalk and you'll eventually run into her.

A.	She'll only talk to you if you actually bump right into her.

Q.	How do I get these #)(@#$)&%? skates on??

A.	Hey, this is a family hint book!

A.	You can't put them on in the store, you have to find a place outside.

A.	Go out onto the Boardwalk and select the Rollerblades icon from inventory.  Click the Rollerblades on yourself, and you'll walk over to the bench, sit down and put on the skates.  Then click the Walk Icon on the Boardwalk to get up and start skating.

Q.	How do I get these $#@()@#! skates off?

A.	What did we tell you about gutter language?

A.	Take them off the same way you put them on.

A.	You'll notice that the skates are still in your inventory. Select them and click them on yourself...you'll skate over and remove them.

Q.	How do I get my deposit back from Ivana?

A.	You'll need to give her back her property.

A.	You'll need to have removed your skates and gone into her shop.

A.	Select the skates from inventory and click them on her to give them back to her.  She'll give you back your money, or part of it, after she's assessed the damage you've done.  If you gave her the Pocket Protector instead of Tramp Silver Dollars, she'll give you that back...meaning the skate rental cost you absolutely nothing!

Q.	Help!  I'm swimming, and I can't get up!

A.	Wattsamatter, didn't you pay attention during your swimming lessons?

A.	Swim to the left.

A.	Eventually you'll swim up onshore by the Tramp Casino.  Next time, be careful not to get too close to the edge of the Boardwalk!

Q.	Lana doesn't seem to acknowledge me.  Is it my breath?

A.	First, you have to be on skates.

A.	Second, when you find her, you have to bump into her.

Q.	I'm talking to Lana, but she doesn't seem inclined to shake hands with John Thomas, if you know what I mean!

A.	When you bump into her, she'll sit down with you on the bench.  Right?

A.	Talk to her by clicking the Talk Icon on her.

A.	Talk to her again.

A.	Talk to her again.

A.	Talk to her again.

A.	Talk to her again.  She'll invite you to come to the Mud Night Madness show, and you'll agree to meet her there. That's your big chance to "make the grade!"

Q.	The bouncer won't let me enter the Ballroom in the Casino!

A.	There's a charge for the show, you know!

A.	It'll cost you $25 in Tramp coins to watch.

A.	If you've met Lana, he'll also allow you to participate in the show if you have $500 in Tramp coins!

A.	Select the Tramp Coin Icon from inventory and click it on the Bouncer.    

Q.	I can only watch Jennifer Jiggle in the Ballroom!

A.	There's worse problems to have than being able to watch Jennifer Jiggle!

A.	Maybe you need to go skating and meet Lana first.

A.	Maybe you need to have Lana invite you to the Mud Night Wrestling Show, and maybe you need to accept!

Q.	Lana just stands ankle-deep in mud deriding my manhood.

A.	A feeling not wholly unfamiliar to you?

A.	Maybe you only agreed to watch, and only paid the Bouncer $25. You'll have to go pay the bouncer the full $500.  If you don't have that much, you'll have to go back out into the Casino and gamble your way to $500.

A.	Then go back into the Ballroom, pay your money, and walk down to the edge of the ring!  You'll automatically join her in the mud when the time comes.

Q.	I'm getting down and dirty in the mud with Lana, but there's body parts all over the screen!  What am I supposed to do about that?

A.	Those aren't just any body parts, they're Lana's!

A.	C'mon, give her a taste of her own medicine!

A.	It's sort of an arcade game, but sorta not!  Move the hand cursor around the screen as quickly as you can to "grab" those body parts!  This kind of thing can lead to bigger and better things (or so you hope!).

Q.	I didn't get our little tussle in the mud on videotape. What did I do wrong?

A.	Maybe the battery wasn't charged?  If not, you should have charged it up at the Atlantic City airport, with the outlet all the way on the west side of the terminal.

A.	Maybe the tapes weren't degaussed?  You should have degaussed all three back at PornProdCorp.  If you didn't, you blew it big time!

A.	Maybe you forgot to put a tape into the camera?

A.	Maybe you simply neglected to turn the camera on.  You should turn it on about the time that you first sit down in your ringside seat, just before Lana comes out to perform!

Q.	I'm done in Atlantic City, I think!  How do I get back to the Airport?

A.	You don't need a phone to call a limo this time.

A.	A classy place like the Tramp Casino has limo service just waiting for you.

A.	If you speak to the right person.

A.	If you're sure you're finished at Atlantic City, click the Talk Icon on the valet standing to the right of the entrance to Tramp Casino.

Q.	I have this nauseating feeling I forgot to do something in Atlantic City.

A.	Maybe it's the food?

A.	Maybe you forgot to reclaim your camera at Ivana's, or return your skates?

A.	Maybe you forgot to turn on the camera and get footage of your Mud Night Madness Wrestling?



6. In Miami

Q.	I want out of this airport.  It's full of depressing references to very old people and drug addicts.

A.	Limo service is available if you read the ads overhead.

A.	But you have to have a quarter.

A.	And you have to find a working phone.

A.	See the questions that follow about finding quarters and finding a working phone.

Q.	Buddy, can you spare a quarter or two?

A.	Yes, there are two quarters to be found in this airport.

A.	But you'll have to stick your finger into a tight, dark location (poor you).

A.	Click the Hand Icon on the coin return of the cigarette vending machine on the west side of the terminal.

Q.	There's got to be a phone I can use here somewhere!

A.	You would think so, wouldn't you?

A.	Try the east end of the terminal.

A.	Try all of the phones.  One of them still works! Apparently, some vandal didn't do his or her job!

Q.	I don't have the money to pay the company I just called!

A.	We're talking about the "Just Green Cards" company, right? If not, don't read any further.

A.	You won't need to pay them anything.  They'll leave the merchandise anyway.

Q.	Where do I find what I just purchased over the phone?

A.	Weren't you listening?

A.	They said they'd leave it outside on the garbage can.

A.	So go look outside on the garbage can, next to the ATM!

Q.	Where should I tell the limo driver to take me?

A.	Look in your inventory carefully.  Don't you have a Miami address somewhere?

A.	Look through the resumes.  There should be something in one of them that gives you a Miami location.

A.	Look in Chi Chi Lambada's resume for Doc Pulliam's business card.  Click the business card on the limo driver and she'll be happy to drive you there!

Q.	Hey, I bet I can find Chi Chi in that Gymnasium!  How do I get inside?

A.	You can't do it yourself.

A.	You'll have to find somebody to help you.

A.	Only Chi Chi herself can let you in, so concentrate your efforts on finding Chi Chi.

Q.	The only appointment I can get at Dr. Pulliam's is months from now!  How can I get in to see Chi Chi?

A.	Maybe you need to convince the receptionist that you have an urgent dental problem!

A.	In the movies and comics, how do you know when somebody has an obvious toothache?

A.	You need to find something to wrap around your head.

A.	Take the doily sitting on the table in the Dentist's waiting room.  Select the doily from inventory and click it on your head.  Then click the Talk Icon on the nurse's station window to show her your achin' head!

Q.	That Chi Chi is a knockout!  But how can I get her to...you know...LIKE me more?

A.	She has the capacity to be very, very grateful.

A.	But she's not working here legally.

A.	You need to give her the Green Card you got earlier!  She'll be happy to show you her gratitude (among other things)!

Q.	What's that you say?  I don't have one of those!

A.	Did you explore the airport thoroughly?

A.	In particular, did you read all the advertisements?

A.	You should have made two phone calls.  One of the overhead ads is for "genuine" Green Cards.  Using one of the quarters you got from the cigarette machine, call the Green Card number and have them send over a green card.

Q.	I didn't get our gymnastics session on videotape.  What did I do wrong?

A.	Maybe the battery wasn't charged?  If not, you should have charged it up at the Miami airport, with the outlet all the way on the west side of the terminal (by the cigarette machine).

A.	Maybe the tapes weren't degaussed?  You should have degaussed all three back at PornProdCorp.  If you didn't, you blew it big time!

A.	Maybe you forgot to put a tape into the camera?

A.	Maybe you simply neglected to turn the camera on.  You should turn it on just before you give the Green Card to Chi Chi, before she drags you downstairs and teaches you the Lambada!

Q.	How do I arrange transportation?  I'm ready to go back to the airport!

A.	Are you positive?

A.	Are you absolutely sure?

A.	Alright, then go back upstairs to the Dentist's office and use the phone.  It's sitting on a table on the left.

A.	Call the number of the same limo service you called to get here from the airport!



PATTI'S PARTS

7. At the FBI Lab

Q.	Commander Twit is just standing there watching me.  What am I supposed to do?

A.	He wants to see that you have an interest in the goings-on at the Lab.

A.	Explore the area.

A.	In particular, click the Eye Icon on the workers in the area.  When they've demonstrated their latest projects, move to the next screen to the right and do the same.

Q.	Should I copy down all this information Commander Twit is giving me?

A.	Use your instincts.

A.	What do you honestly think?

A.	YES!

Q.	I've been fitted with a "Safety First Field Locator Device," and now the lab seems deserted.

A.	Do a little more exploring.

A.	You may find several items that were left there for your benefit.

A.	Pick up the Dataman and the two DataPaks sitting on the counter near the computer.  Then you can leave.

Q.	The sonic transducer is causing my "Safety First Field Locator Device" to tingle and vibrate.

A.	You should be so lucky.

A.	There is no sonic transducer, you're just reading this clue to see what titillating (pardon the expression) information we would give you.

A.	Incidentally, at the point in the game where Dr. Phil Hopian fits you with the Safety First Field Locator Device, we wanted to use the line, "In Her Majesty's Secret Cervix." But it was deemed a little too racy, so we're putting it in here just so you can share it with your friends (if you have any)!  Pretend you made it up and be a big hit!

Q.	Okay, am I done here yet?  A.	As long as you have the phone number Commander Twit gave you.

A.	And the Hooter Shooter.

A.	And it would help to have the Dataman and the two DataPaks, though it's not strictly necessary.

A.	All right, you may go.


8. In The Limo

Q.	How do I tell Bobby where to take me?

A.	You don't, you show him.

A.	One way is to show him a fax from Desmond.

A.	Another way is to show him the Dataman (when it has a DataPak plugged in).

A.	If you have a fax, select it from inventory and click it on Bobby, your driver.  If you have the Dataman and the DataPaks, insert a DataPak into the Dataman and select the Dataman from inventory.  Click the Dataman on Bobby and he'll take you to the address shown on the LCD readout.

Q.	Can I receive and send faxes?

A.	You can't send them.

A.	But you can receive them.

A.	But you can only receive them if you DON'T have the DataMan and the DataPaks!  (If you have the DataMan and the DataPaks, you won't need any faxes, since they duplicate the information.)

Q.	I left the FBI without getting the information and addresses I need for my investigation.  What do I do now?

A.	You'll have to get faxes from Desmond.

A.	You'll have to call Desmond and request the faxes, one at a time.

A.	Call the number you were given by Commander Twit and request either of the faxes.

Q.	Can I use the phone?

A.	Yes.

A.	You can call Desmond at the FBI.  Commander Twit gave you the phone number when he created a computer account for you.

Q.	Who should I investigate first?

A.	Do I look like an FBI agent to you?

A.	It doesn't matter.

A.	You can investigate Reverse Biaz and des Rever Records in any order you want!

Q.	Is there anything in here I need?

A.	Yes.

A.	There's something you can use in the course of your investigation.

A.	Grab the bottle of champagne on the rack of liquor on the left.

Q.	The fish is making rude comments about my perfume.

A.	He should talk.

A.	Never mind him, he's sloshed.

A.	You have got to stop reading spurious hints like this one. They won't help you at all, they'll just distract you from the important matters at hand.



9. At K-RAP

Q.	How did I get here?

A.	Don't you know?  Don't tell me YOU'VE got amnesia, TOO?

A.	You showed the K-RAP fax to Bobby, your limo driver.

A.	OR you showed the DataMan, with the P.C. Hammer DataPak inserted, to Bobby, your limo driver.

Q.	I'm outside of K-RAP.  Is this tiny building it?  This should be a cinch.

A.	If it's such a cinch, why are you reading this hint?

A.	Appearances can be deceiving.

A.	K-RAP is built into the side of a mountain.  Just wait 'till you go inside!

Q.	How do I get into Mr. Krapper's office?

A.	The secretary won't let you in, so don't wait for her.

A.	You must have the correct access code for his office door.

A.	Fortunately, you have it in your possession!

A.	Look at either the fax or the DataMan readout on K-RAP.  The access number will work when you click your Hand Icon on the control panel next to his door.

Q.	I'm inside Krapper's office.  It sure is swank!  But what am I looking for?

A.	Evidence.

A.	You'll have to scout around, since all the evidence is in his locked desk.

A.	You'll have to find a way to unlock his desk.

Q.	How do I get the desk open?

A.	There are two possible ways.

A.	You can either pick the lock or open it with the correct key.

A.	The first is to pick up the letter opener sitting on the desk, then click the letter opener on the desktop to pick the lock.

A.	The second is to find the key.

A.	The key is hidden in the room.

A.	More specifically, the key is hidden in the humus of the tall plant in the upper right corner of the room.

A.	Click the Hand Icon on the base of the plant to find the key, click it again to pick up the key, then click the key on the desktop to unlock the desk.

Q.	I can't find any evidence at all!  And I'm sure that secretary is about to come back and blow my cover!

A.	Okay, first unlock the desk, as described in the hint above on how to open the desk.

A.	Then click the hand on the desk to open the drawer and look. 

A.	First you'll find a blue stickum with a number on it. Remember that number!

A.	Click the hand on the desk again to look further.

A.	The second time, you'll find a file folder filled with incriminating evidence!

Q.	How do I get outta here?  I can't go the way I came in, and there doesn't seem to be any other exit.

A.	A.	First you have to leave Krapper's office the way you found it.

A.	That means: return the letter opener to the desk, return the key to the humus, and return the file folder to the desk.

A.	First, be sure you've made photocopies of the evidence in the file folder!

A.	To do that, select the file folder from inventory.  Now click the file folder on the copy machine on the left side of the room.  Don't be surprised if the machine breaks down!

A.	Once you've made the photocopies, put the originals back in the desk.  Now you're dirty, and you've got an excuse to use the shower!

A.	Go into the bathroom to the left and click the hand on the shower.

Q.	I'm buck naked at the bottom of the elevator shaft!  What should I do?

A.	Go back upstairs.

A.	Oh, you can't do that.  Better stay downstairs.

A.	There's a fresh change of clothes right next to the elevator.  Click the Hand Icon on the clothes to wear them.

Q.	I can't go upstairs and I can't find an exit.  I'm down among the studio doors, but they're all locked.  What do I do now?

A.	You can open one -- and only one -- of the doors down here, on the far right side of the studio area.

A.	But you need to have found the access code upstairs.

A.	The access number for Control Room B. can be found on a blue stickum in the desk of Mr. Krapper's office upstairs.

Q.	I'm missing my clothes and everything in my inventory. Should I restore to an earlier game and find another way to handle that shower?

A.	This is a normal part of the game.

A.	Do not attempt to adjust the gameflow.

A.	No.  You'll get everything you need back again if you solve the puzzles down here in the Studio Area.

Q.	I'm inside an empty control room.  Is there anything to do in here?

A.	You betchum!  You can gather all sortsa nasty evidence against P.C. Hammer and "2 Live 2 Screw" if you run things correctly.

Q.	Exactly how do I gather evidence while in this control room?

A.	"2 Live 2 Screw" is conveniently discussing illegal activities in one of the other studios.

A.	You can record their conversation and take the tape with you.

A.	First, using the hand icon, take a reel-to-reel tape off the rack (they're in the center rack against the far wall, a bit more than halfway up).

A.	Second, place the reel-to-reel tape on the tape deck in the lower left hand corner of the studio.

A.	Third, click the Hand Icon on the control panel (to the right of the reel-to-reel tape deck) six times to find the proper input channel.

A.	Fourth, click the Hand Icon on the reel-to-reel tape deck to start recording the evidence.

A.	When P.C. Hammer has blocked the door with the mike stand, click the Hand Icon on the reel-to-reel recorder 3 times to stop the recording, rewind the tape, and take it off the tape deck.

Q.	I've been locked in here by P.C. Hammer!  How do I escape?

A.	Do your Ella Fitzgerald imitation.

A.	Make sure the volume is loud enough to do some damage!

A.	Click the Hand Icon once on the control panel to turn up the sound in the control room to ear-splitting level.  Click the Talk Icon once on the microphone to shatter the control room glass!



10. At des Rever Records

Q.	How did I get here?

A.	You poor dear, you blocked out the whole ugly scene, didn't you?

A.	You showed Bobby, the limo driver, the Reverse Biaz fax.

A.	OR you showed Bobby, the limo driver, the DataMan with the Reverse Biaz DataPak inserted.

Q.	I'm inside the magnificent Shill Building, but I can't seem to get the elevator to work.

A.	You can't.

A.	But somebody else can.

A.	It's under the control of the sleepy guard.  He can summon the elevator for you.

Q.	The guard is sleeping and won't cooperate.

A.	You'll have to be persistent and clear.

A.	First, talk to him.  That should wake him up momentarily. Now you have to tell him where you want to go.

A.	Pretend he's a limousine driver!

A.	Once you have him awake, show him either the Reverse Biaz fax or the DataMan with the Reverse Biaz DataPak inserted. He'll call the elevator for you.

A.	Another way is to look at the building directory all the way on the left side of the screen.  Then click the Talk Icon on the sleeping guard twice.

Q.	I'm in the lobby of des Rever Records, and I can see Reverse Biaz behind a pane of glass.  Should I just waltz on over there?  

A.	It can't hurt to try.

A.	Just click the Walk Icon on the floor in front of the doorway next to the window.

A.	However, there are certainly other things to be done in this big, fancy, empty lobby!

A.	And you'd better do them now, because once you meet Reverse Biaz, you'll need to make a quick getaway.

Q.	I've got a Gold Record, but I'm not sure what to do with it!

A.	It's got important evidence on it.

A.	You'll have to play it on the stereo just underneath the Gold Record to find out just what the evidence is.

A.	You'll have to play it in forward and REVERSE in order to hear the subliminal messages!

Q.	How do I operate the stereo?

A.	Click the Hand Icon on the stereo to get a closeup.

A.	Use the Eye Icon on each of the buttons to see what they do.

A.	Put the Gold Record on the turntable by selecting it from inventory and clicking it on the turntable.

A.	Start the record spinning by clicking the hand icon on the appropriate button.  Click the Hand Icon on the tonearm to place it on the record.  After the record has played for a moment, press the reverse button and play the record backwards.  Click the Hand Icon on the 78 button to listen to the record at 78 RPM backwards!

A.	Press the Stop button and wait for the turntable to stop spinning.  Don't forget to take the Gold Record with you!

Q.	Reverse Biaz obviously expects me to do SOMEthing in this recording studio, but I have no idea what.

A.	You weren't listening to your cover story, were you?  Aren't you ashamed?

A.	You're filling in for one of their studio musicians.

A.	You're supposed to play the large synthesizer in the center of the room.  Click the Hand Icon on it to walk over and start playing!

Q.	I'm trying to make this gig happen, but, like, I know nothing about music!  Won't I blow my cover?

A.	Not to worry, Uncle Al has it all taken care of.  Just do your best.

A.	The first two takes will probably be washouts.  Don't worry about it!

A.	Through the miracle of the Al Lowe Magic Home Synthesizer Course, you will perform like a virtuoso on your third performance!

Q.	I'm in the Control Booth with Reverse Biaz!  I can't get any hard evidence, though.

A.	There are two ways to get some evidence from Reverse Biaz.

A.	One of them is to simply do what comes naturally!

A.	When you're with Reverse in the Control Room, click the zipper on him and let nature take its course!

A.	A better way is to select the Champagne Bottle from inventory and then click the bottle on Reverse Biaz.

Q.	I have a cassette from Reverse Biaz, but why do I think I could have gotten even more evidence of his scurrilous activities?

A.	Maybe you're suspicious by nature.

A.	Maybe you played through the game and heard yourself say that you couldn't find any evidence in des Rever Records' outer office.

A.	Maybe you should have taken the Gold Record off the wall and played around with it.  



11. At The White House

Q.	This is a long cartoon!  Can I do anything during this sequence?

A.	If you couldn't, would we bother putting a hint here?

A.	Yes, you can.

A.	In fact, when the time comes, you better!

Q.	Uh-oh!  We're being held at gunpoint!  What to do, what to do?

A.	Something you've been waiting to do since the game started!

A.	You were given your Hooter Shooter by Desmond, weren't you?

A.	Select the Hooter Shooter from inventory and click it on Julius Bigg!  


12. When You're Finished

WARNING!  Don't read this section until you've already finished the game.  It may tip you off to things you don't want to know about unless you've seen the ending.

HAVE YOU TRIED...

Using the Boom Box in the Tape Room at PornProdCorp?
