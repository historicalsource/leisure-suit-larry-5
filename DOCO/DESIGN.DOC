										  -------------


Perhaps Larry really did make billions as a savings and loan tycoon in
"LSL4:  The Missing Floppies," perhaps not.  No one really knows for sure,
including Larry!  But since those halcyon days of yesterdisk, his life
script has soared like a Stealth boat anchor.  He assumes he found fame in
LSL4 as he is fortunate to have his present job in the glamorous Hollywood
entertainment industry.  Unfortunately, his job is as Chief VCR Rewinder and
Sterilizer (Beta Division) at the all new "America's Sexiest Home Videos,"  a
proposed tawdry syndicated television show nearing production that solicits
home videos primarily distinguished by their creative bed sheet stains.  To
those who ask, "Larry, why don't you quit that lousy job?" Larry, of course,
replies, "What?  And give up show business?!"

Actually Larry's memories of LSL4 are quite vague.  As LSL5 begins, his most
recent memories involve programming some computer on some deck beside some
lake with some woman named Passionate Patti.  Whatever happened to her?  Poor
Larry has no idea.  Now he's alone in Hollywood working a minimal wage job.  
Since"LSL4:  The Missing Floppies" is missing, Larry's memory of those disks
is also blank!  How he wishes he knew what had happened to him!  Could he
really have lost a whole year, a tenth of a decade, a hundredth of a
century?  Yep.  

Meanwhile, Patti's memory is unaffected, although sometimes she would like to
forget.  Her career has been one semi-moderate success after another, ever
since that fateful scene (which Larry doesn't remember) when she left our
Leisure One standing at the altar of The Little Church in Yosemite Valley! 
What a waste!  She dumped a good man to run off to Hollywood just for one of
those oncein-a-lifetime recording deals.  Of course, after all the
composing, arranging, rehearsing and recording work was actually done, the
deal turned out to be just another show biz snow job.  When she returned for
Larry, he had mysteriously vanished without a trace.  So Patti resumed both
her career track and her worldly ways.  She is presently on a whirlwind
national tour of famous airport hotel cocktail lounges.  She and Larry  in
two different worlds.  

We begin the game at a meeting of some gentlemen with organized crime
written all over them.  It seems  the Mafia has lost a major source of 
revenue in recent years:  pornographic theaters and adult bookstores.  Who
needs them when you can watch the same stuff on cable without leaving the
comfort of your own living room?  The boys want to regain their lost market
share.  How?  Why, by producing a show so rank, so vile, so filthy that even
the U. S. Congress will be forced to tighten U. S. obscenity laws, outlawing
anything remotely dirty, thus cleaning up the airwaves, forcing all
red-blooded Americans back where they belong:  adult bookstores!

Quietly, they contact PornProdCorp (a major Hollywood production company),
explain the problem, explain the goal, (explain the alternatives) then
"request" their help.  With great fanfare, PornProdCorp announces "America's
Sexiest Home Videos," a show in which ordinary, All-American families submit
videos made in the privacy of their ordinary, AllAmerican bedrooms just to
win prizes.  To "get the balls rolling" they hold a contest to find the
hostess of the show, the sexiest woman in America.  They  receive thousands
of video audition tapes from ordinary, All-American, over-sexed housewives.  
It's tough work, but they finally narrow the competition down to three
finalists.  This creates a problem:  they know if they bring these women to 
Hollywood to audition, they'll all be sexy.  They want a woman so passionate,
so over-sexed, she'd go for any man, any loser, any dork, no matter how 
lame!  Where could they find such a man?  Fortunately, right under their
noses!

It seems PornProdCorp recently employed a certain Larry Laffer to rewind (and
disinfect) those very same audition tapes.  Thus, Larry has his new quest: 
audition the three sexiest women in America without their knowledge that he
is anything but plain, simple Larry.  His "victims":  a wealthy black NYC
junk bond broker, programtrading specialist, and computer hobbyist named 
Michelle Milken; a ditsy Atlantic City blondebombshell, former beauty
pageant runner-up and wet T-shirt contest entrant, now professional mud 
wrestler/casino change girl named Lana Luscious; and a Miami-based
Latin-American lambadadancing former gymnast, now "green card-less" dental
hygienist named Chi Chi Lambada.  

While flying to his encounters, Larry daydreams of Passionate Patti and the
glamorous life she must be leading without him.  Each dream dissolves into 
the reality of Patti's present-day life.  Unfortunately, the reality is not
so pretty.  We first find Patti in a Georgetown piano dive being stiffed (so
to speak) out of her last two weeks pay by the Mob-controlled nightclub
owner.  As she leaves the club, an undercover FBI agent offers her a chance 
to get even.  "Why not service, er, serve your country by working under
covers, er, undercover?  Investigate Mob influence in the music biz."  Of 
course she's interested in revenge, especially when he mentions a possible
White House gig.  After all, she suspects the bum who cheated her on her 
album contract in "LSL4:  The Missing Floppies" was involved in organized
crime.  So she agrees to go to FBI Headquarters with him, gets outfitted with
several neat gadgets in a scene reminiscent of James Bond's "Q," and is
(gynecologically) fitted with a secret transmitter.  The FBI books her a 
series of gigs as cover and places a limousine and driver at her disposal. 
She is assigned two men to investigate:  a Baltimore recording studio
engineer specializing in backwards subliminal message recording named Reverse
Biaz; and a former computer hardware builder, now obscene rap lyricist/disc
jockey at Philadelphia's K-RAP radio named P. C. Hammer.  

On the way to her encounters, Patti daydreams of various rich and famous men
(not including Larry Laffer).  During her dreams, we dissolve back to Larry,
whose airplane is conveniently nearing his destination.  As Larry leaves
the jetway he becomes ego again.  This "ego transformation" happens seven
times during the game.  The player's inventory flip-flops along with the
character they're presently playing.

After Larry's third daydream, as he's on his way back to Hollywood with his
three videotapes, we see Patti get debriefed by her FBI boss.  She learns she
will get to play at the White House when suddenly, without a dream sequence
or other transition, we cut back to Larry in his airplane.  This time,
Larry's face is facing downward, for the plane is plummeting to Earth.  Larry
rescues the airplane full of passengers, lands it safely (by tripping over
the throttles at just the right moment), and becomes a National Hero.  He 
receives a telephone call from the President, inviting him to a big State
Dinner to be held in his honor.  Unbeknownst to Larry, the after-dinner 
entertainment:  Passionate Patti, of course!  

At the dinner, Patti eventually is seated with Larry, Desmond, and Mr. Bigg,
the Mafioso chieftain.  He hustles her up, singing a soft love song into her
ear and promising her she'll be the hostess on a new TV show.  Larry
recognizes his show and calls Bigg on it.  Patti recognizes the song as one
she wrote for her album in Larry4.  Since there's no way he could have heard
it without playing the game, he must have "The Missing Floppies" and 
therefore, also must be the man she's been chasing all along.  The FBI
arrests him, making Patti a hero along with Larry.  To get even with 
PornProdCorp, Larry erases the videotapes of his three girls.


So, all's well that ends well?  Well, as the game ends, we learn that all
Larry's "work" was for naught as the ASHV producer "simplified the audi-
tions" by magnanimously awarding the hostess gig to his girl friend; ASHV
went on to become the megahit of the season; recordings no longer contain
subliminal messages since no one has figured out how to play CDs backwards;
the Mob's porn biz got steadily worse and worse; Congress never did get
around to doing anything to clean up the airwaves; the entertainment industry
is slightly more honest; and Leisure Suit Larry and Passionate Patti are
together again!  


                                Game Structure
										  --------------


This game attempts to implement the "meanwhile back at the..." device of
film-makers through the use of two parallel, non-interacting adventure games
in one.  Ego changes back and forth between Larry and Patti, never under
player control, but only at the conclusion of a major segment of the game. 
The two games (and egos) meet only in the closing cartoon.  Larry has three
cities to visit and Patti has two different ones.  The cities may be played
in any order, but only one trip to each city is available.  Though you must
solve the puzzles in a city before leaving, all the necessary pieces are
available, i.e., you are never stuck without something you missed in an
earlier area.

The overall structure works like this.  After an initial introduction where
Larry learns of his goals for the game, he flies to a city; falls asleep on
the flight and dreams of Patti.  We then dissolve to Patti's real life, she 
gets her introduction to learn her goals.  After she works her way through FBI
Headquarters, she falls asleep in her limousine, dreaming of a rich and
famous man (not Larry).  We then dissolve back to Larry awakening from his
dream in time to land at the airport of the first city.  This device is used
to change back and forth three times, with the player ending as Larry in our
"flight stimulator" rescue.  Inventory hops back and forth as ego changes
between Patti and Larry

                               Plot in Detail
										 --------------


Our opening cartoon begins with a group of obvious Mafiosi sitting around a
conference table, watching a looney business slide-show presentation with
elaborate 256-color sales charts.  Mr. Bigg begins the meeting by announcing
he is ready for their annual reports.  Mob Flunkee #1 says, "As you know,
ever since LPs in the 50s, our recording industry subliminal message
campaign, "Just Do Drugs,"  has been a resounding success.  Drug sales have
never been larger, while prices remain firm."  He shows us Slide #1:  an
arrow indicating the growth of Mob drug profits versus record industry
investments (it has a shape subtly similar to an erect penis).  "Discounting
our one abortive push to quadraphonic, results have been most gratifying,"
he concludes.  Flunkee #2 begins, "Our pornography division also enjoyed a
period of explosive growth."  He shows us Slide #2:  another upward-trending
arrow (with a similar shape) representing 1955-1980 revenues from porno-
graphic movies and magazines.  "Unfortunately, after a quarter century of
positive ROI, recent results have been definitely flaccid."  He shows us 
Slide #3:  revenues dated 1980-1990.  "We attempted to counter this trend
with an investment in rap music, thinking teenagers' continuous exposure to
those lyrics would help our sales.  But the result is obvious:  painfully
declining penetration!  Our market research failed to foresee the widespread
growth of cable!  Even when we forced through rapidly reduced VCR prices in
the early 80s it just didn't help our X-rated movies sales -no one buys
them!  Why should they, when they can use their remote controls to flip
through channel after channel of almost the same stuff in the comfort of
their own homes?  Now even the networks are getting into the act!"  We cut
back to Mr. Bigg, who responds, "I understand the problem, but I want a
solution!"  His eyes leave no doubt as to his meaning.  We fade to black.  

A few months pass.  We are in another business meeting, but this time in a
more refined, glamorous setting.  A large sign proclaims "PornProdCorp: 
Home of 'America's Sexiest Home Videos.'"  PPC President Filthy McNasty (the
first person to identify this reference wins Al's eternal admiration!)
speaks.  "Our contest to find "The Sexiest Woman in America" to serve as our
hostess has been a tremendous success!  We searched for a woman beautiful
yet with All-American girl next door looks; a woman virginal and untouchable 
yet sexy and slutty.  We've received thousands of submissions, and narrowed
it down to three finalists.  But, we know if we bring these women to 
Hollywood to audition, they'll all be sexy.  We're looking for a woman so
over-sexed she'd drop for any man, any loser, any dork, no matter how lame!  
Yes, our little Vanna Black must be one exceptional woman!"  In a
"masterful stroke," the producer decides to hold double-blind auditions,
where the women don't know they're auditioning and the auditioner is a man so
inept, so sexless, so lame that it would take the sexiest woman in America to
possibly find him appealing.  "Wherever will we find someone like that?" they
ruminate.  Heh, heh, heh.  Of course, we know he's right under their noses.  

We cut to the hallway outside that very same conference room to find our
Leisure Suit Larry under our control.  He hears the word "COFFEE!" shouted
from the conference room door nearby.  He finds the coffee pot in the
hallway, stumbles into the conference room and trips over his own feet,
attracting their full attention.  "What a dolt!  The sexiest woman in America
wouldn't be attracted to this.." thinks McNasty.  Suddenly he shouts, "Hey,
wait a minute, you!!  Everybody else, out!  I want to speak to Mr. Laffer
personally!!"  The room clears as Larry hears the pitch.  "What?  You want me
to personally audition three women?"  Of course, why it's a dream come true! 
But, there is a catch.  "Remember we're looking for their reactions to a
"normal" guy like you, Larry.  If you tell them who you are, or of your 
powerful new position with the show, it won't be a valid test," says
McNasty.  "Instead, videotape your meetings on this brand new, imported,
.5-lux, Rob Lowe Model Complete-Video-Studio-in-aPocket-Protector.  They
must never suspect you are filming them!  If you can pull this off, I promise
you a big promotion:  Assistant Associate Director!  But because of its tiny
size, the camcorder's recording time and battery life are severely limited,
so be sure you recharge when you finish with each girl."  (Why, that's always
a good idea, thinks Larry!)  

OK.  Now Larry is set up to visit three over-sexed women.  He leaves Filthy
McNasty's office, finds his video workshop, finds and takes the battery 
charger from the workbench, finds an electrical outlet, plugs in the charger,
and inserts the camcorder into the charger.  While it's charging, he finds
and takes the degausser from the workbench drawer, grabs three videotapes off
the shelf, and applies his degausser to the videotapes.  He finds the file
room, opens the file drawer labeled "Finalists," takes the three finalists'
folders from the drawer.  Anytime he has the folders, he can open one and
examine the contents.  One contains a Hard Disk Cafe napkin; another, a Tramp
Casino matchbook; and the third, a business card from "Doc Pulliam's Dental
Hygiene Heaven."  He then finds and takes the Aerodork Gold Card from the
file room's credit card imprinter.  He walks back to his workroom, grabs the
camcorder from the recharger, takes the charger from the outlet, and inserts
a degaussed videotape into it.  He walks outside, climbs in the waiting
limousine, and heads for the airport.  The limo driver is young, beautiful,
desirable and unobtainable.  They may chat during the short rides, but
nothing will happen.  

The limousine drops him off at Aerodork Airline's convenient curbside "ATM
Check-in Service."  If he has the Aerodork Gold Card with him, the limou-
sine drives away.  (If he forgot it, he must return to the office to get
it.)  Larry inserts the Gold Card into the Automatic Ticket Machine, sees an
ATMtype screen that offers only game-approved destinations, clicks on his
choice of destination and out pops a Boarding Pass.  During the game, players
may visit Larry's three cities (and Patti's two cities) in any order.  For
right now, we'll select New York City first to call on Ms. Michelle Milken. 
Larry takes the Boarding Pass, enters the terminal, crosses the lobby to the
security checkpoint, and passes through the metal detector.  (Add jokes
here)  The door of Aerodork's Chartreuse Carpet VIP Lounge is just beyond. He
flashes his Aerodork Gold Card to the security TV camera to gain admittance. 

The Chartreuse Carpet VIP Lounge consists of four bare walls, a burned-dry
coffee pot, and a folding chair.  Fortunately, it's already time to board. 
The flight is announced, a "Now Boarding" sign flashes over the door in the
rear wall, Larry walks to the door, and inserts his Boarding Pass into the
ABM slot  The pass is retained by the machine.  The door opens and he walks
down the first class jetway to his flight.  (You may wonder how the other 
passengers got on ahead of him.  He doesn't!)  We cut from the jetway to a
first-person view from his seat, behind a woman with a large hat blocking 
most of the airplane's movie screen.  We watch (the edges of) the pre-flight
safety video lecture (during which Larry may take the In-Flight Magazine from
the seatback pocket), then cut to a long shot of the airport to watch the
plane takeoff.  From the takeoff we cut to a satellite photo of the U. S.,
see Larry's plane begin trace a red line between L. A. and New York City.  We
return to the "seatback" scene.  

Knowing his flight will be uneventful, Larry begins to daydream, thinking of
Passionate Patti and what might have been, maybe could be, maybe even was.  
If the magazine is still there, he could grab it now.  We see his vision: 
Patti playing a classical piano recital in the Parthenon in the moonlight. 
She finishes, rises from the bench, and we cut to a reverse angle, showing
her from behind, bowing to a standing ovation from a huge lavishly dressed 
audience.  As Larry drifts off to sleep, we dissolve to the reality:  Patti's
huge audience becomes a few scattered souls; her ovation becomes a smat-
tering of applause; and the Parthenon becomes "The Piano Pit," a rather seedy
jazz club/sing-along piano bar in Georgetown, Virginia.  We commence the
second half of our opening cartoon as Patti walks off the grimy little stage
into the grimy little office of the grimy little nightclub owner.  

He begins their conversation by firing her!  It seems "the Boys" didn't much
care for her small audiences; her fans "listen too much and drink too 
little"; how can he and "his backers" be expected to make a profit like
this?  He stiffs her out of two week's pay, she leaves in disgust, returns to
the stage, grabs her charts, and walks out the back door into the dark film
noire alley behind the club.  Waiting for her in trench coat and slouch hat
is FBI Inspector Desmond, who plays on her anger and convinces her to help
her country while getting even with the Mob.  They walk off-screen to his 
waiting car and we iris in, cover their short drive to FBI HQ in D. C.
through text, then iris out to see Patti seated in Inspector Desmond's
office.  He explains her mission:  she is to go undercover, learn of any Mob
influence in the entertainment industry and obtain sufficient evidence so the
FBI can convict them and clean up the business.  Specifically, she is to
investigate subliminal messages in popular recordings and the recent spate of
obscene rap recordings.  If she can learn anything about radio station payola
that would be a bonus.  In return, the FBI will set her up with a tour as
cover and take care of all her travel arrangements.  First class, of
course.  Yes, a private limousine for her exclusive use.  (Mention is even 
made of a possible White House gig if things go well!)  Patti consents. 
Desmond tells her to visit Commander Twit for outfitting, she leaves his 
office, and we are again under player control, but now with Patti as ego. 
(This long cartoon sequence is, like all others in this game, easily bypassed
by choosing an icon or by pressing the FF icon.)

Patti finds Commander Twit's laboratory and sees many silly things Twit could
give her.  Commander Twit shows her a security clearance, a codename ("Agent
88," of course), her contact's telephone number, plus some silly things she
can't really use in the game:  computer account, E-mail ID number,
password, etc.  He tells her to see the staff physician, Dr. Lyccus Von Pelt,
for her official departmental checkup and "fitting" for her "Safety First"
Field Locator Device.  She finds Von Pelt's office and discovers the
"fitting" is slightly more intimate than she expected.  You see, Dr. Von Pelt
is the resident gynecologist!  She climbs in the stirrups and we cut to a
Patti-eye view of his head between her legs (which are demurely covered by a
sheet).  As he raises the sheet, a hint of a smile crosses his lips.  "Assume
the position," he smiles. "Oh, sorry, I used to be a street cop!"  (Insert 
cavern, clam, and fish jokes here.)  He inserts a metal probe, the screen
shakes, he replies, "Oh, sorry; let me warm that for you."  She squirms.  
"Oh, sorry; perhaps something in a D-width?"  Patti gets her "Locator"
installed, the doctor leans back to light a cigarette, and Patti is on her
way.  

She finds herself under player control back in Twit's Laboratory.  Patti
finds a "DataMan" and two corresponding ROM cartridges for the two villains
she's seeking from his desk.  She walks outside to her waiting limousine (we
reuse Larry's limousine, but with a male driver), enters the limo, and is
asked where she wants to go.  Reading her DataMan, she discovers she has a
choice of two men to investigate:  P. C. Hammer at K-RAP, a 24-hour, rap
music radio station in Philadelphia or Reverse Biaz at des Rever Records in
Baltimore.  (Alternate:  she can use the cell phone to call Desmond (using
the telephone number given her by Twit) who will fax her the info she needs
on the limo's fax machine.)  She can do either place first; we'll begin with
Baltimore.  She gives him the Baltimore address, then settles back for the
trip.  She notices a nice bottle of champagne resting in the limo bar and
grabs it.  We watch the limousine leave the curb, return to the interior
scene with Patti, when she begins to daydream.  (The player immediately
recognizes the similarity to Larry's airplane dream of Patti.)  But Patti
doesn't dream of Larry; rather, she pictures herself enjoying the good life
with some extremely rich men.  In this first dream, she sees herself sailing
on The Tramp Pianist with Donald Tramp, enjoying the good life, performing
Czerney on his chest.  We cut to a close-up of Donald smiling, which melds
into Larry smiling, still in his airplane seat where we left him.  

We return the same airport long shot, show Larry's airplane land, then cut to
the jetway scene.  He leaves the plane through the exact same set of rooms as
at the L. A. airport and player control is returned.  (We reuse the same
airport pix repeatedly for ALL the airports.  Only the addToPics are 
changed to protect the animators.)  Thus, we leave Patti daydreaming during
her limousine ride, and Larry is again ego.  Patti's inventory is gone and 
Larry's (small that it is) is back.  

Larry reads a limousine ad on the airport wall, learns the telephone number
of the local limo rental company, finds a cigarette machine, feels in the
change cup, finds some quarters, finds a telephone, dials the limousine
company, then walks outside to find his rental limousine waiting.  He reads
Michelle Milken's resume and learns she's a computer freak who loves to hang
out at the Hard Disk Cafe near Wall Street.  (If he hasn't read the resume,
he won't know the address but can use the limo's cell phone to telephone his
office and have them fax him the address.)  He shows the driver the address. 
He looks at the inside of the limousine and discovers a previous passenger
has lost his DayTrotter address book/calendar/everything notebook, so he
takes it.  Soon the limousine arrives at the Hard Disk Cafe.  

He exits the limousine, it leaves, he enters the building and finds himself
in the Hard Disk Cafe's lobby, which is decorated with computer memora-
bilia.  When he requests a table, the maitre d' (the same maitre d' from
Larry2 and Larry3) is unhelpful unless Larry slips him lots of cash from
the DayTrotter, or begs him for quite a long while.  Finally, the maitre d'
consents to make Larry a membership tape.  He punches Larry's name and credit
card number into a piece of paper computer tape, then places the tape in the
punch tape reader by the cafe entrance where it is read, then returned to
him.  The tape reader's screen tells him the "track & sector number" of his
table, the gate swings open, and he enters the restaurant's seating area, a
large room with a few diners scattered about randomly at many tables.  He
sits down to wait for Michelle Milken, which gives us a chance to do a sight
gag.  

A man in shirt sleeves and tie enters the cafe, walks to a corner, and faces
the crowd with his arms folded.  One-by-one the tables of diners notice him,
rise, move to a table near the rear.  When he's done, all the diners are
arranged in tidy, contiguous rows.  The man turns and leaves.  If player
clicks on him, he gets the message, "Why, that's Peter Norton, defraging the
Hard Disk Cafe again!"  This, of course, only happens once; from then on,
Larry is free to enter and leave.  

Soon thereafter we see Michelle enter the cafe, pass Larry's table to enter
the Herman Hollerith Room at the rear.  When Larry tries the door, he finds
another punch tape reader.  He inserts his tape; it's rejected with a
"SystemLevel User" message.  He returns to the lobby, reads the InFlight
Magazine (which contains a story about early machines that use present-day
computer principles), looks at the exhibits in the lobby museum, finds the
music box and wraps his punched tape around it.  The music box punches
additional holes in the tape that the paper tape readers then read as
"Gilbert Hyatt," who, of course, has the highest level of clearance in all
microprocessors.  (Alternative solution:  Larry gives the maitre d' all the
DayTrotter's credit cards as a bribe.)  Larry then reenters the cafe, walks
through, and uses his new membership tape to enter the private room at the
rear.  (If Larry enters the cafe with the "enhanced" membership tape and
hasn't seen the Peter Norton scene, just skip it, and start Michelle in as
soon as Larry sits.)  

Larry sits alone at a table for one, very near Michelle Milken's private
booth.  He strikes up a conversation with her.  When he expresses interest in
junk bonds, she expresses interest in obtaining his money.  She invites him
to join her in her booth and we cut to a close-up of the two of them alone in
a booth.  She orders several deserts ("the bananas du juor") and as they
converse we see close-ups of her sucking whipped cream from various
pastries, etc.  Even Larry catches this message.  They converse, with Larry
always choosing the financial answer.  (Alternately:  at any time after the
close-up, give her the DayTrotter's information concerning mutual funds,
Swiss bank accounts, etc.)  Following the instructions in the game's documen-
tation, Larry sets up his Pocket Protector Camcorder to record.  (If he
forgets, things still happen, but the tape will just be blank.)  Soon we cut
to a reverse angle showing Larry's face and just his side of the table. 
Michelle slides beneath the tablecloth while discussing the relative merits
of insured versus uninsured bond(age).  Larry's eyes glance downwards, then
roll back in his head.  He gasps, he smiles, he fades to black.  

We iris out to find Larry in the lobby of the HDC, without his DayTrotter,
membership tape, or Michelle.  He applies his last quarter to the pay 
telephone on the wall, calls the limousine company, walks outside, finds the
limousine waiting, enters, and arrives at LaGuardia, his mission accom-
plished.  He purchases a ticket at the ATM for either of his two remaining
locations (for this document, we'll choose Atlantic City).  He follows 
through the same airport procedures again, including another "I Dream of
Patti" sequence.  This time Patti's floating through Venice in the moon-
light, casting romantic glances at her gondolier.  We dissolve to the reality
only to find Patti fending off the backseat advances of her limousine
driver.  She escapes the limousine (and the driver) and finds herself outside
The Shill Building in Baltimore where the FBI has booked a keyboard cut-in
session for her.  Unlike Larry, Patti's limousine driver is only too happy
to wait for her (heh, heh, heh) so she could leave the building at any time,
return to her limousine, and head off for the next city.  If she does, she'll
miss lots of points, of course, but it is possible.  

A guard sits at a table limiting access to the elevators.  He asks her for
her destination.  She reads the DataMan to learn the office number of des 
Rever Records.  (Alternate:  she finds the office number by reading a glass
case on the wall containing a list of all the building's tenants.)  She 
gives the guard the office number, he phones upstairs, gets approval and
summons an elevator for her (all without leaving his desk since he has no
legs).  Since the elevator is controlled from the guard's panel, it
automatically takes her to the proper floor.  We never see inside the
elevator -after its doors close in the lobby, we cut to the doors opening
in the lobby of des Rever Records.  The office walls are mostly glass, which
generates some nice 3-D effects.  The lobby connects the recording studios,
control rooms, and offices.  It also contains a record player with turntable,
amp, speakers, and a gold record mounted on wall.  Patti can take the gold
record and apply it to the turntable.  It sounds fine at 33, but if she plays
it at 78 she hears "DAT causes impotence."  (Hmm.  Must be a pre-Sony CBS
recording.)  If she plays it in reverse, she hears "Porn is best at a quarter
a whack!"  She keeps the gold record for evidence.

As she walks through the lobby toward Studio A at the rear, she hears a
speaker crackle, "Come into the studio, Patti.  I'm waiting for you."  She
does, and meets Reverse Biaz, the studio's chief engineer and specialist in
backwards subliminal message recording.  He tells her the synth is pro-
grammed, the charts are on the music stand, the levels are checked and he's
"ready when she is!"  Patti sits at the synth, we cut to a close-up with just
a keyboard and some music.  He announces, "Take 1," the music starts, and the
player must click on the on-screen piano keyboard at approximately the right
time to complete the recording.  It will take several takes.  If they can't
do it, it's ok; we'll just cheat and do it for them.  After she finally gets
a good take, Reverse invites Patti into the control room to hear the
playback.  

She enters the control room, they listen to the tune, he compliments her
playing and she has the chance to question him about his success in the biz. 
Eventually, he mentions his speciality and how good business has been
lately.  Once she's heard the evidence she needs, she asks for some samples 
of his work for her collection.  He says he'll gladly give her some samples
of his work if she'll give him some samples of her work!  Eager to "serve her
country" (especially with such a cute man), she consents and we discretely
cut back to the recording room pic, where we see her and Reverse get it on
through the window.  During their passion, Patti accidently hits the Record
button with her foot, recording their lovemaking.  Later, Reverse adds a 
simple drum track and a synth bass part.  At last Patti has a hit record! 
(She just doesn't know it!)  (Alternate:  she can give him the champagne she 
brought from the limousine.  He'll talk a while, give her the tape, then
chatter aimlessly for a while.)  

We iris in to black, then iris out on Patti in the limousine.  The driver
asks for a destination.  She reads the DataMan (or uses the cell phone to
call Desmond at HQ), tells the driver the destination, and she's on her way
to Philly.  This trip she dreams of Wild Willy Gates, lying on a huge, bed-
room-sized, circular waterbed with wave-machine attachment, their interesting
parts covered only by strategically-placed infrared Chiclet keyboards.  We
cut to a close-up of Willy whispering romantic source code and major computer
vender deals in her ear, which dissolves into Larry snoring away in his
airplane seat where we left him.  His airplane lands, Larry leaves the jetway
and walks into the Atlantic City airport.  Again, Patti is daydreaming during
her limousine ride, and ego is Larry.  

Larry reads a limousine ad on the wall to learn its local office's telephone
number, finds a row of slot machines, finds some quarters forgotten in the 
machines, finds the telephone, calls The Tramp Limousine Service, walks
outside and hops in the waiting limousine.  The driver asks for the destina-
tion.  If he has the resume, he can read it, and then tell her the address. 
(Alternate:  use the limo's cell phone to call Hollywood to learn it.)  He
then rides to his next encounter.  

Larry's limousine pulls up before The Tramp Casino on The Tramp Boardwalk, he
gets out, and the limousine pulls away.  At the door to the casino stands a
not-very-interactive doorman and a very-interactive scantily-clad woman,
asking passersby to "Hey, wanna get lucky?  Guess the number of which I'm
thinking of."  Larry guesses, is right, and wins a silver dollar.  (Any time
he has no money, he guesses right!  Any time he has money, he guesses wrong! 
What are the odds?)  Now he can play video poker inside the casino.  He 
enters the casino, walks to a poker machine, and plays poker until he wins
some money.  Leaving the poker machine, he enters the ballroom at the rear of
the casino, pays the bouncer $25, and sits in the front row of "The Tramp
This! Wet TShirt Contest."  When he's had his fill, he leaves.  (You're
right, there's no reason to have a wet Tshirt contest here; I just thought
we'd all want to be there for the CD-ROM photo shoot!)  

He leaves the casino, heads east down The Tramp Boardwalk.  The boardwalk
never ends (well, ok, maybe at screen 32,767!).  To return to the casino he
must walk west the same number of scenes he walked east.  The back edge of
the boardwalk is solidly blocked by businesses.  The near edge isn't; if he
steps off it, he'll fall into the sea.  He doesn't die, but just swims west
until he comes to the beach in front of the casino.  Some kids and a few men
rollerblade along the boardwalk scenes, passing Larry by, but there is only
one woman.  She is, of course, Larry's lucky video lady, Lana Luscious, the
woman he is to contact.  His problem is:  how?  

Larry finds the rollerblade rental shop on the boardwalk, enters, pays for a
rental with his money from the casino (Alternate:  he can leave his cam-
corder as deposit, if he doesn't have enough winnings), removes his shoes,
puts on the rollerblades and skates off.  He skates terribly at first, but
slowly improves with practice as the timer expires.  While skating, we
prevent him from falling off the edge with a funny, out-of-balance loop. 
After he's learned how to rollerblade, we add Lana Luscious to the scene. She
skates a little slower than Larry so he can catch her.  If he does catch her,
he talks to her and she suggests they head for that nearby bench and rest. 
After they sit, we cut to the close-up of Lana's face.  (Alternate:  He drops
a hundred-dollar bill on the boardwalk close to her; she'll stop skating to
return it to him, then accept his offer to sit down and rest a while.)

Lana tells him her hopes and dreams, her wishes and desires, her ambitions
and fantasies, but mostly just invites him to the big mud-wrestling 
tournament that begins shortly back at the casino ballroom.  No fool, Larry
agrees to meet her there.  He returns the rollerblades to the rental shop (if
necessary), retrieves his shoes and deposit (or camcorder) and walks to the
casino ballroom, which no longer hosts the "Tramp This! Wet T-Shirt Contest,"
but now the "Tramp This! Mud Night Madness" mud wrestling contest.  If Larry
pays the bouncer $25 again, he sits down, Lana enters, stands in the middle
of the ring and taunts him, urging him to "come on up!"  Larry pays the 
bouncer $500 to enter the contest.  He flips on his camcorder and heads up
the stairs into the ring (vat? pen?).  Lana attacks him immediately!

We switch to an arcade game spoof with a bizarre interface.  Female body
parts appear on screen with the instructions "Click to grab here."  Mostly 
they're arms and legs and necks and shoulders, but occasionally as the player
moves close to click on one it changes beneath his cursor to a more inti-
mate body part.  Sometimes as the player moves near, a part will disappear
and another part appears.  This is all a smokescreen, since what really
matters is how often the player clicks the mouse and the number of seconds
we've been wrestling.  Larry and Lana wrestle, soon Lana is on top and
appears to be winning, but eventually Larry flips her over onto her back, and
spreads out on top of her going for the pin.  She squirms, he squirms, they
squirms, suddenly there's squirms everywhere!  They both breath heavily,
moaning sounds emanate from the CD-ROM drive, and they move ever more slowly
and subtly, eventually rolling off the far edge of the stage just as things 
get good, landing on the floor at the feet of the front-row patrons.  We see
the audience's eyes widen, we see muddy clothes fly, we see men cheer, but we
see nothing of Larry and Lana.  We get a few laughs, iris in to black, then
iris out on Larry outside the casino entrance.  He talks to the doorman, asks
him to summon a limousine, it soon arrives and he's off to the airport.  Upon
arrival, he purchases a ticket at the ATM for his remaining location (for
this text, all we have left is Miami).  He follows the same airport
procedures again, including another "I Dream of Patti" sequence.  

This time, he sees her playing a strap-on keyboard synth (in a very
provocative way) before the reflecting pool in front of the Taj Mahal in
the moonlight.  We hear a few bars before dissolving to the final Patti
reality -Patti standing near her limousine in front of K-RAP Radio in
Philadelphia, listening to a broadcast over its exterior speakers of an
advertisement for The Taj Mahal Cafe.  Again, since the limousine waits for
her, she could leave at any time, return to the limousine, and head for her
next city.  This (and only this) region takes place at night.  

As she enters the lobby, we cut to a reverse shot of the building's exterior,
revealing the top floor was just a small part of the entire structure, which 
stretches down a long hillside in a series of rooftop patios.  We linger just
long enough for the player to understand this is not really a small one-story
building at all, then we cut to the lobby inside.  Patti finds a bank of
elevators, an unattended receptionist's desk, and the office door of Mr. John
Krapper, Founder, Owner, President and C. E. O. of K-RAP Radio.  His office
is secured with a combination lock.  She refers to her DataMan, learns the
combination, enters it and the door opens.  She enters carefully, only to
find his office deserted.

Weird spotlights create pools of light, leaving portions of Krapper's
office in darkness.  The city lights are spread out in a spectacular view
from his panoramic windows.  Patti changes from dark to light as she walks
around the office.  She finds a locked desk, but picks the lock with the
letter opener lying on the desk.  (Alternative:  use the spare desk key,
which he keeps hidden in the plant by the window.)  Inside Krapper's desk
Patti finds the combination to the downstairs control room doors and a folder
of incriminating evidence in the desk's filing drawer.  A personal copier
rests on the table.  If Patti tries to take anything out of the room, the
game won't let her leave.  ("He'll surely miss that, Patti!  Better return
it.")  She can, however, use his photocopier to make copies then return the
originals to the desk.  Unfortunately, the copier jams before the copies are
finished.  She automatically opens the copier to repair it, toner explodes
everywhere, and she is transformed into Blackface Patti.  She returns
everything where she got it (retaining just the copies), but now she can't 
leave by the front door ("the receptionist has returned").  She notices the
"shower" in his bathroom.  If she is not dirty, she can't enter the shower.
("You don't need a shower right now, Patti.  You're not dirty."  "(Well,
you're not soiled!)")  She removes her clothes, hangs them on a nearby hook,
climbs in the shower, turns on the "faucet," and the "shower" lowers through
the floor, leaving her clothes behind.  ("Patti!  You're so 
em'bare-assed!!")  She descends through the atrium lobby in Krapper's glass
elevator, naked and blackfaced, past floor after floor of office windows
that fill with staring workers as she passes.  The elevator comes to rest in
the downstairs broadcast area.  

As she steps from the elevator, she notices a M. C. Hammer-style rapper's
outfit hanging conveniently on a nearby hook, grabs it, and is instantly 
transformed into "Rappin' Patti P."  With her hip clothes and her newly-black
skin, she may now wander the area with impunity.  She finds herself in a
complex of closed cubicles containing workers dressed similarly to her,
discussing something she cannot hear.  She feels certain their conversations 
would be revealing to her mission.  Wandering next door, she finds the
station's control rooms.  

Using the combination she learned upstairs, she unlocks Control Room B,
enters, and finds a microphone, dozens of knobs, sliders, and meters, plus a
few usable pushbuttons labeled with the names of various offices.  By pushing
the buttons she can spy on the conversations in the other small 
studio-offices.  She places a reel of tape on one of the recorders and
records their incriminating conversations.  Unfortunately, as she records 2
Live 2 Screw incriminating themselves, P. C. Hammer (the DJ in Control Room
A) observes her, deduces what she's doing, walks from A and blocks the door
to B with a huge mike stand.  He then leaves to get help!  Patti is trapped 
in Control Room B!  Using the control room mike, she sings a powerful high
"C" and we see the glass walls shatter!  (Alternate:  talk to P. C. via
microphone before he leaves his Room A, invite him to Room B, offer him the
champagne from the limo, he gets drunk and tells all.  You record him, and 
the others, then leave him there.)  Patti finds the elevators to the rear of
the room (not the glass one), returns upstairs, exits right past the recep-
tionist (still in her Rappin' clothes), enters the limousine, and heads back
to FBI HQ.  This time, she dreams of Scrooge McDuck using a skiploader to
pour money over her naked body!  

We dissolve back to Larry landing in Miami.  He recharges his camcorder,
reads the last girl's resume and installs a fresh tape in his camcorder.  
He finds no money in any of his normal locations, but does find a charity
collection container, and steals a few quarters from it.  ("There goes your 
chance for the "Larry's Kids" Labor Day telethon!")  Here he finds a new ad: 
a company selling "replacement" green cards for aliens who have "lost their
cards."  Their logo is a Latino man smiling and winking.  Larry finds a
limousine company ad, calls the number from a pay phone, then dials the 
counterfeiters and gets a card made.  They leave instructions to pick up the
card outside the airport in a few minutes.  "It'll be on the trash can by the
limousine stand.  Be sure you leave my $1000, ok?  (click)"  Larry leaves the
terminal, finds the trash can, takes the card, and "forgets" to leave the 
money (since he has none!).  His limousine is waiting nearby.  The driver
asks for a destination.  If he's read the resume, he's found Doc Pulliam's 
business card.  (If not, he can use the limo's cell phone to call Hollywood
and ask for the address.)  

His limousine arrives below the second-story, walk-up offices of Doc Pulliam,
discharges him and leaves.  He climbs the exterior wrought-iron stairway
beneath the giant revolving neon bicuspid, up past the "Gym-Dandy Gymnastics
Center" and enters Doc Pulliam's waiting room.  The "helpful" receptionist
completes the humorous forms in triplicate, ending with "is this an
emergency?"  Since it isn't, he may have an appointment in nine months and
slams shut the sliding window.  Larry uses the telephone in the waiting room,
dials the number on Doc's business card, convinces the receptionist he's Dr.
Payne, and he's sending one of his emergency clients over for Doc Pulliam. 
"His name is Larry; Larry Laffer!"  (Alternative:  Larry walks over to the
waiting room magazine table, pulls the small, white doily out from under the
WWII-vintage magazines, wraps it around his head in classic 3 Stooges
toothache style before walking to the window.)  

He knocks on the receptionist's window.  She slides it open.  "Why, you poor
dear!" slobbers the receptionist, as she ushers him inside to Chi Chi
Lambada's Dental Hygiene Heaven bay, "come right in."  We cut to Larry in the
dental chair as Chi Chi Lambada enters the cubicle and stands beside him. 
(Larry's eyes beam.  He has had fantasies about gymnasts!)  Latin Muzak plays
over the dental office's P. A. system.  reclines the chair and leans over
him.  The chair is at the perfect angle for her to lambada Larry's arm and 
leg, which really turns her on.  We cut to an extreme close-up of her face,
showing ceiling for background.  The music makes her dance, Larry plays
along.  The more Larry talks to her and the hotter the music becomes, the
more she rubs herself on his arm and the more excited she gets.  "Have you
ever considered dental floss an aphrodisiac?"  (Alternative:  if Larry has
the green card, the conversation goes in a different direction.  She wants to
live here legally.  If only there were some way... you get the drift.  He
gives her the card and we can skip the dancing talk.)  She suggests they
adjourn to her apartment downstairs adjoining the old gymnastics studio. 
Quickly, Larry sets the Pocket Protector to record.  We iris in to black, 
then iris out on the gymnastics studio after hours.  The camera is peeking
through her Venetian blinds, looking in from outside the building.  We see
Larry and Chi Chi flail around, passing back and forth before the window,
executing tumbling runs, bouncing on trampolines, hanging by their heels from
rings, etc.  We iris in to black, then out on Larry standing outside the
building.  ("This is great, you think; you've been wanting to get more 
exercise!")  

Larry returns to the dentist's waiting room, uses his telephone to call the
limousine service, walks outside to find it waiting, enters, rides to the 
airport, gets a ticket for L. A., enters the plane, takes off and we go
through the same "dream of Patti" sequence again.  This time Larry sees 
himself in the role of Rick with Patti as Elsa in the closing scene from
Casablanca.  "You may not thank me now, but someday you know that the two of
us don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy, mixed-up world we live
in..."  The dissolve to reality shows Patti in that same trench coat, but 
Inspector Desmond is Rick, debriefing her ("And you assumed that had
something to do with removing underwear!").  In so doing, Desmond informs 
the player of any points missed in the Patti portion of the game.  "Well,
Patti, I've got good news:  you're the background music at the next White 
House dinner party."  Right in the middle of this joyous conversation we cut
to Larry in his airplane seat.  

This is NOT like the other transitions; it's sudden, obviously there's an
emergency -something's wrong.  Boy, is it!  This time, Larry's face is
facing downward, for the plane is plummeting to Earth.  An announcement
requests "passengers with flight experience may wish to report to the
cockpit."  The pilot has just drained the airplane's liquor stores and is
unable to fly!  ("What!  No co-pilot?"  "Cost containment.  Do you think
prices like ours are an accident?"  "Yeah; an accident waiting to happen!"  
"They don't call us Aerodork for nothing.")  

Since Larry once sold flight simulator software, he volunteers.  We cut to a
three-way split screen, showing an immense cockpit smothered with dials, 
knobs, switches, gauges, CRT screens, etc. on the top half, a close-up view
of Larry panicking in the lower-left quarter of the screen, and a long shot
of the plane plummeting to Earth in the lower-right quarter.  Through some
tricky maneuvering (none of which works) plus accidentally catching his coat 
sleeve on the controls (which does), Larry pulls the plane out of its spin,
saving the passengers.  He then lands it safely (by tripping on the rudder 
pedals at just the right moment), and becomes a Big National Hero.  Leaving
the same old jetway, he receives the typical, after-the-game, congratula-
tory telephone call from the President, inviting him to "a big State Dinner
in your honor, Mr. Lafner!  Of course, I'll be unable to attend, but I will
send the Vice-President."  We iris in to black, then out on a long shot of a
big White House dinner party.  

We see the dais in the back, with two empty seats near the Vice-President. 
Patti is seated near the entrance with Desmond, her date.  Mr. Bigg, the 
Mafioso chieftain we met in our opening cartoon, in town to testify at a
major Congressional hearing on interstate trucking, is seated on the dais
near the V. P.  Larry is announced as the guest of honor, he enters, spotting
Patti immediately.  She rises, they embrace, he asks her if she'd like to
join him at the dais ("since I had a little trouble finding a date,").  She
agrees, and without asking Larry, invites Desmond too.  Since there are only
two chairs, and Patti and Desmond grab them, Larry is left standing.  A
Secret Service agent walks in with a folding chair, sets it up for Larry, and
he squeezes between Quayle and Desmond.  So now our dais line-up (from
left-to-right) is Quayle, Larry (sideways), Desmond, Patti and Bigg.  

Bigg hustles Patti during the soup course, singing her a soft love song while
attempting to tempt her with a job as hostess of a new TV show he calls 
"America's Sexiest Home Videos."  .c1.He attempts to impress her with his
brilliance.  "See what I've done:  I've produced a TV show so vile, so 
repulsive, so blatantly pornographic, so obviously obscene, that even our U.
S. Congress will have no choice but to respond with legislation tight enough 
to make the airwaves "Beaver" clean again, thus reviving pornography."  Larry
recognizes Bigg is referring to his show and calls Bigg on it.  Patti 
recognizes Bigg's love song is one she composed for her LSL4 album.  "There's
no way you could know that song without having played LSL4!  You're the one
who stole "LSL4:  The Missing Floppies" and you must be the man I've been 
chasing!  Desmond, arrest him!!"  Bigg leaps to his feet, pulls a gun from
his pocket and aims it at Bigg.  Larry throws himself on top of the V. P., 
slamming his face into the custard pie just placed on the table by the
waiter.  A Secret Service agent sneaks up behind Bigg, pulls his arm up as
the gun fires, then helps Desmond wrestle the gun away.  Bigg is handcuffed,
and hauled away by Desmond and the nameless S.S. agent, leaving Patti
dateless.  She turns to Larry, "So it looks like I'm free for the weekend? 
How about you?"  Quayle thinks she's talking to him and replies, "I could set
things up for Camp David..."  Larry assumes he's being magnanimous, thanks
him and hopes he'll get a chance to come along.  "You've always been a
personal hero of mine, Mr. V. P.!!"  

We cut to the White House lawn at sunset.  As the chopper takes off and
slowly disappears into the sunset, we wrap up all our loose ends through text
as the credits fade in and out over the lawn.  "So, all's well that ends
well?  Well, well!  We learn all Larry's "work" was for naught as the ASHV 
producer "simplified the auditions" by magnanimously awarding the show's
hostess gig to his girl friend; ASHV went on to become the megahit of the
season; recordings no longer contain subliminal messages since kids can't
figure out how to play CDs backwards; the Mob's porn biz continued to
decrease; Bigg pleaded insanity due to the high sugar content of the White
House dessert; Congress never did get around to doing anything to clean up
the airwaves; the entertainment industry is only slightly more honest; and
Leisure Suit Larry and Passionate Patti are together again!"  "Hey, Larry,"
says Patti, "ya got any good videos we can watch during the flight?"

Suicide ManWill we ever be able to implement this?  Probably not.  There is a continual,
nonsense, running gag where occasionally upon entering a scene, a man is
visible in the corner.  He attempts suicide and fails.  Sometimes he walks
off-screen, sometimes he just keeps on trying. No point, no reason.  (Rather
like flasher in LSL1.)  Choose from the following or add your favorites: 

	asphyxiation
	guillotine, decapitation
	blow brains out
	break neck
	burn at the stake

Throughout this chapter, underlined text indicates mouse click actions by the
player.  

"Material inside quotation marks" indicates print messages.  All character
dialog windows in which a character responses to player input includes a
"talking head" of that character.  Text in print windows is not normally 
inside quotes, unless it is dialog said by a character.  

The picture change style "iris in, iris out" is reserved to denote the passage
of time.  The iris in goes to a completely black screen, we pause 3 seconds,
print a message telling what happened, then iris out on the following scene. 
"Wipe from right" is reserved to denote a "Meanwhile..." scene. 
"Meanwhile...'s" all use the same frame.  Following a "Meanwhile..." we "wipe
from left" to the next scene.

110	Copy Protection Spoof 

First screen up upon anyEvent is a spoof of document-based copy protection. 
Screen says "Please remove your clothing and compare yourself to the
photograph on page n of your manual. Click OK when ready!"  Click and see,
"Do you have less or more?"  Click and see, "Less or more what!?"  Click and
see, "Boy do you look foolish!"  Run "Opening Larry Cartoon." 


115	Trivia Quiz 

I guess we have to do this again. Larry3 was the best way I can think of. 
Let's rip it off until something better comes up.  Credits I prefer we list
anybody who makes a significant contribution to the game.  There is no
special picture background for credits.  Instead, use the Larry3 style, in
which the credits dissolve in and out over actual game play.  We'll show 'em
all again (in same manner) at the end of the game over the closing cartoon,
as the helicopter disappears into the sunset.  

TouchTone Dialer 

Standard telephone pushbuttons.  We'll make the * and # do something funny. 
Show buttons depress. We'll do a spoof of voice mail ending in a circular
loop with "press 1 for more".  Several phone numbers in doco will actually
work here.  Sierra numbers, including 900 hint line.

120   Mob boss' office

Medium shot.  Many gangsters sitting around conference table in Mr. Bigg's
office.  Expensive decor, clothes; inexpensive taste.  Bigg wants to hear
their annual reports.  Flunkee 1 begins. He ain't real bright, but nice 
suit.  

Flunkee 1 explains problem.  "As you know, ever since LPs in the 50s, our
recording industry subliminal message campaign, "Just Do Drugs,"  has been a
resounding success.  Drug sales have never been larger, while prices remain
firm as this slide shows."  He projects Slide #1, a parody of presentation
software slide shows.  It shows an arrow indicating the growth of Mob drug
profits versus record industry investments (it has a shape subtly similar to
an erect penis).  Over the slide, Flunkee 1 continues, "Discounting our one
abortive push to quadraphonic, results have been most gratifying," he
concludes.  "Now to you, Biff."  Flunkee 2 is another rocket scientist.  

Flunkee #2 begins, "Our pornography division also enjoyed a period of
explosive growth as you can see from this slide."  Cut to Slide #2, another
upward-trending arrow (with a similar shape) representing 1955-1980 revenues
from pornographic movies and magazines.  Flunkee #2 continues,
"Unfortunately, after a quarter century of positive ROI, recent results have
been definitely flaccid."  He shows us Slide #3:  porn revenue, 1980-1990. 
"We attempted to counter this trend with a heavy investment in rap music,
thinking teenagers' continuous exposure to pornographic lyrics would help
sales of our wider product line.  But the result is obvious:  painfully
declining penetration! Our market research failed to foresee the widespread
growth of cable!  Even when we forced through rapidly reduced VCR prices in
the early 80s it just didn't help our Xrated movies sales -no one buys
them!  Why should they, when they can use their remote controls to flip
through channel after channel of almost the same stuff in the comfort of
their own homes?  Now even the networks are getting into the act!"  He is
interrupted by the boss...

130   Mr. Bigg Close-up 
We cut back to Mr. Bigg, obviously angry, steaming, who responds through
clenched teeth, "I understand the problem, but I want a solution!"  His eyes
leave no doubt as to his meaning.  We fade to black.  

140   Office of the President, PornProdCorp

"Six Months Later"  Another business meeting, but this time in another, more
refined, glamorous setting.  PPC Flunkee #1 is concluding his report to the
President.  "And so, I'm pleased to say our contest to find "The Sexiest
Woman in America" to serve as our hostess has been a tremendous success!  Our
Vanna Black character will be one exceptional woman!  We searched for a woman
beautiful yet with All-American girl next door looks; a woman virginal and
untouchable yet sexy and slutty.  We've received thousands of submissions, 
and narrowed it down to three finalists.  I intend to have these three women
flown here, first class, wined and dined before the auditions.  National
press coverage will be arranged.  In short, everything is proceeding 
according to schedule."  He sits down to a burst of applause.

PPC President Filthy McNasty speaks, "But, wait.  I know if we bring these
women to Hollywood to audition under those circumstances, they'll all be
sexy.  I'm looking for a woman so over-sexed she'd drop for any man, any
loser, any dork, no matter how lame!  I think we should hold a double-blind
audition, where the women don't know they're auditioning and the auditioner
doesn't know he's auditioning."  

PPC Flunkee #2 interjects, "But, that's impossible.  We need videotape for
review purposes.  I don't know how we could do that!"  McNasty agrees, "Yes,
we do need to review.  But what if you could find an auditioner so inept, so
sexless, so lame, so unappealing that it would take the sexiest woman in
America to find him attractive."  Sounds of "Great idea!"  "Of course!" 
"Masterful stroke!" ring out.  "But, Fil--, er, Mr. McNasty!  Wherever will
we find someone like that?" they ruminate.  We scroll off screen right to the
hallway immediately outside the McNasty's office where we find our hero
patiently waiting to begin the game.  

[after Larry gets the coffee pot]  Screen scrolls back right.  In walks Larry
carrying the coffee pot, passes behind Bigg and turns to pour coffee into his
cup.  We cut to...

145   McNasty gets scalded

We see Larry bump the glass pot against the edge of the table, breaking the
glass and spilling coffee all over McNasty's lap.  He screams in pain and
anger, "You clumsy idiot!" shouts McNasty.  "What a dolt!  Who hired this
fool?  Sexy women?  Why, the sexiest woman in America wouldn't find..." 
Suddenly his tone shifts while a light bulb appears over his head, "Hey, wait
a minute!  Wait a minute!!"  We cut to "Close-up of McNasty" below.  

150   McNasty and Larry 2-shot 

Larry sitting alone with Filthy McNasty.  "Nice leisure suit," he begins
sarcastically.  "What's your name?"  "My name is Larry; Larry Laffer."  "How
quaint," he responds, ignoring your semi-colon, "your first and middle names
are the same.  Well, never mind, here's the deal.  Luffner, we're looking for
a hostess for our new show.  We have three women selected as finalists, but
we're all too busy to hold auditions.  So I want you to "audition" them for
us."  He smiles and winks.  "You do understand about how we "audition" girls,
don't you, Loafer?"  You're charmed.  "What?  Audition three women?  No
problem, boss, I'm your guy!"  Why it's a dream come true!  But, here comes
the catch.  "But, Loaner, if you tell them who you are, or of your powerful
position here, it won't be a valid test," says McNasty.  "We want to see
their reactions to a nice, normal guy like you, Lori," he pulls out a pocket
protector loaded with colored pens.  "So I want you to videotape your
"meetings" on this brand new, imported, .5-lux, Rob Lowe Model
Complete-Video-Studio-in-a-Pocket-Protector.  You must never let them suspect
you are representing the show or that you are filming them!"  He smiles as he
hands it to you.  "If you can pull this off, Lipper, I promise you a really
big promotion:  perhaps even Assistant Associate Director!  What do you think
of that?"  You think, "Wow!  This could be the big break I've been hoping 
for!" But to McNasty you reply, "I promise to give it my all!"  He concludes,
"But because its a new model and its tiny size, this little baby's recording
time and battery life are severely limited.  Be sure you recharge after each 
girl."  ("Heh, hey.  Always a good idea," you think!)  "OK, Safford, you've
got two days.  Better get the girls' bios from the file room and get going!" 
We cut back to Larry standing near the (now gone) coffee pot.  



                         "PornProdCorp" -Hollywood 

The home offices of the production company creating "America's Sexiest Home
Videos." in glamorous Hollywood, CA.  Larry works here.  There is no
connection made between the Mob and PornProdCorp.  

160   PornProdCorp lobby

A transition between Larry's Workroom, McNasty's Office, File Room and
exterior.  Exit East to exterior.  A large sign proclaims "PornProdCorp: Home
of 'America's Sexiest Home Videos.'"  

[During opening cartoon]  There's a coffee pot here with a pot of coffee.  We
come here for a short player control section:  Cries of "Coffee" emanate from
the boss' office until Larry takes coffee from the stand.  Under program
control he heads into the boss' office.  We cut back to "Office of the
President, PornProdCorp" above for continuation of cartoon.  DAC machines
will hear real voices yellling for "coffee!"

[After opening cartoon]  Game begins with Larry standing here with pocket
protector in inventory.  Larry thinks to himself, "How did I get here?  How
did I end up in this job?   The last I remember, I was programming on a
porch!"

Coffee pot is gone; nothing else to do with coffee area.  Look in area of
Larry's workroom hallway gives "Chief VCR Rewinder and Sterilizer (Beta
Division)"  Look door of McNasty's office gives "Filthy McNasty, President,
C. E. O., C. F. O., C. T. O., C. O. O., Chairman of the Board, Executive
Producer"  Look door of fileroom gives "File Room -Authorized Personnel
Only."  Look near east edge of pic gives "A door leads outside."  Exit via
east edge.

Recharging camcorder at coffee pot outlet (as well as everywhere else where
there's an electrical outlet):  All outlets are a consistent height from the
floor (isn't code 12"?)  so we can reuse same graphics.  Recharger on outlet 
Moving to the electrical outlet, Larry bends over, plugs in the empty charger,
and parks it on the floor.  He's free to move away.  Camcorder on charger (if
charger on floor) Larry moves to outlet again, bends over (same loop),
inserts the camcorder into the charger.  He is free to leave while it's
charging.  Look camcorder while in charger shows time left to complete
charge.  Look camcorder while in inventory indicates length of recording time
remaining.  Can't take camcorder from socket before it's fully recharged.  A
full charge equals 10 minutes of recording time.

A water cooler sits against the near wall, with bubbles occasionally rising to
the top.  If Larry is within a few pixels of it, and faces North, it burps
and Larry says, "Oops.  Excuse me."  Only do once, unless Larry walks 80+
pixels away and returns.  

170   Larry's workroom

Stacks of tapes everywhere.  55-gallon drum of disinfectant mounted high on
wall with hose and spigot hanging down.  Look shelf mostly says "There are
many different types of videotape here."  Finding the tiny tapes says "these
tapes look like they'd fit your new camcorder."  Hand on tiny tapes grabs the
three videotapes, commenting "And you always thought those were DAT tapes. 
You cleverly label the tapes "Girl 1" "Girl 2" and "Girl 3"."

Look workbench reveals a battery charger on workbench.  Hand gets it.  Drawers
under workbench, all at same height (so one loop opens all) all can be opened
with hand.  Most give text gag.  One contains degausser.  Hand gets it.

Anywhere:  degausser on tapes gives, "Sliding the switch to send rapidly
alternating, pulsating currents through your degausser, you sensually rub it
in slow, concentric circles over each girl's dedicated magnetic particles, 
gradually increasing in speed and intensity, until they (and you) are randomly
aligned.  A shudder passes through your body!!  By God, that's degaussing!" 
"You wipe the sweat from your hands."  Set tape state to degaussed.

Anywhere:  tape on camcorder  If tape is degaussed, "OK."  If not, "This
camera requires tapes that have been previously degaussed."  Else, set
camcorder state to tape number loaded.  

Anywhere:  hand on camcorder  opens dialog window with elaborate requirements,
only obtainable through the doco.  We'll flesh this out later.

180   File Room

[first time only]  "Larry looks at the date and realizes a full year has past
and he can remember nothing!  He's had amnesia.  What did he do?  What
happened to Larry4?"

Look drawer mostly gives, "Filthy McNasty Personal" some drawers say "Losers"
but one drawer says "Finalists."  hand on drawer opens drawer.  Can't really
see much in drawer.  Look drawer while open says "Here are (were) the
finalists' resumes."  Hand on drawer takes the three finalists' folders if
they're there, adding all three to inventory at once.  

Look counter says there's a credit card imprinter with a credit card still in
it.  Hand on Counter takes the Aerodork Gold Card from the file room's credit
card imprinter if it's there and he's read the message.  

Anywhere, if he has the folders:  Look folder works like this.  It describes
the contents, then adds an object to inventory.  Look MM adds the Hard Disk
Cafe napkin.  Look LL adds the Tramp Casino matchbook.  Look TP adds the
business card from "Doc Pulliam's Dental Hygiene Heaven."  Those items are
then lookable too.  Each folder tells his destination city, the girl's name,
and how/where to contact her.  

190   PornProdCorp exterior

Show palm trees, Hollywood sign in background.  Door enters PPC.  Limo always
waiting.  Hand on Limo to enter.  Hand on Limo to enter. Show Larry climb
inside, then cut to "Limousine Interior" below.  Generic Limousine 

200   Limousine Interior

This scene is reused in every city as transition between airport and point of
interest.  Each city requires its own logic, messages and driver.  In most
cases, in the previous, exterior scene ego used the hand on limo to indicate
he wanted to enter, we walk ego to the limo, newRoom to here where the limo is
obviously standing still.  The driver waits until the player provides the
input to indicate destination.  The only exceptions are:  when Larry is
finished in a city and can only go to the airport or when Patti is finished
with her second city and can only return to D. C.  In those (four) cases, we
automatically announce to the driver the destination, and the trip begins. At
conclusion of any trip, we see the exterior animation grind to  a stop, have
ego say "thanks for the ride," and newRoom to the next exterior scene
automatically.  Upon arrival in the newRoom, ego is standing beside the limo,
so we never have to see him/her climbing in or out.  Larry's limos always
leave immediately.  Patti's limo waits for her.  

The following things work everywhere:  Fast Forward icon takes us to ego
standing after exiting the limo.  There is a working TV, but it shows is
commercials for other Larry games.  Hand on tv turns it on.  There's a VHS
VCR with Beta tapes, not "takeable."  There's a bar with liquor bottles, all
of which are empty.  Patti's limo has one bottle of champagne.  Hand on
bottle takes.  Hand on onscreen button lowers and raises electric window to
driver compartment.  

Patti and Larry get different drivers, both are young, attractive, sexy,
desirable and unobtainable.  They may chat during the short rides, but
nothing will happen.  If Patti's in the limousine, the driver is Bobby Bang;
if Larry, it's Bobbi Bang (no relation, of course).  In every city, Larry's
girl driver's last name changes spelling (Bangue, Banng, Bahng) but we still
use the same view.  All have same description, etc.  

Hand on cell phone lets Patti call FBI (only?) and Larry call PornProdCorp
offices.  All phones in the game utilize the same touch-tone telephone face
for dialing (see "TouchTone Dialer" below).  The fax machine is for incoming
faxes only.  If Patti uses the cell phone to call the number Twit  gave her,
she gets Desmond's office and requests a fax of the next address she needs.  

                               Larry's limo rides 

departing L. A. 

If Larry has the Aerodork Gold Card, the tapes, the recharger, or the
degausser (he can do without the finalists' folders), he automatically
announces his destination as "to the airport, please!"  He relaxes while we 
cut to the first "Meanwhile..." scene below.  After "Meanwhile..." he arrives
quickly at the airport.  But if he forgot something, upon entering limo,
Larry just sits.  Soon the cel phone rings.  It's Al telling you you're not
ready to proceed.  "Ignore Al / Exit Limo"  "Al says, "Give up?  Ready for a
hint?"  Click 'Yes, I'm a wimp' or 'No, I'll look some more!'"  Give hint or
not.  If he reads the clue, he doesn't get the points, but he doesn't need to
solve the puzzle either.  This same procedure is followed anywhere else Larry
is "locked with no way to make progress."

NYC 

[arriving after airport]  A look shows a previous passenger left his
DayTrotter address book/calendar/ everything on seat.  Can take the
DayTrotter lying on the seat in NYC.  Window to driver is stuck.  Driver 
can't hear us.  Must give destination to driver by showing HDC napkin, or if
no napkin, use phone, call office, get address, driver takes off (he explains
"I just happened to overhear the address.").  After getting destination, limo
starts, we see a little animation of stuff whizzing past outside the
windshield, then pull up at the "Hard Disk Cafe" Exterior.  If he attempts to
exit the limo without the DayTrotter, we give it to him, but give no points.

[returning to airport]  Larry automatically announces his destination as "to
the airport, please!"  Limo starts, we see animation outside begin to cycle,
then do the next "Meanwhile..." (see below).

Atlantic City

[arriving after airport]  Window to driver is stuck.  Driver can't hear us. 
Must give destination to driver by showing Tramp Casino matchbook.  If no
matchbook, can use phone, call office, get address, driver takes off (he
explains "I just happened to overhear the address.").  

[returning to airport]  Larry announces destination automatically, limo
starts, we see animation, then do the next "Meanwhile..." (see below).

Miami

[arriving after airport]  Window to driver is stuck.  Driver can't hear us. 
Must give destination to driver by showing Doc Pulliam's business card.  If
not, he can use phone, call office, get address, driver takes off (he 
explains "I just happened to overhear the address.").  

[returning to airport]  Larry announces destination automatically, limo
starts, we see animation, then do the next "Meanwhile..." (see below).


                             Patti's limo rides 

Washington, D. C.

[after FBI]  Patti sets the DataMan to either destination's info, then shows
DataMan to driver.  Or, she can cell phone Desmond's number at FBI HQ (which
she learned from Twit) and get a fax back in return with the addresses on
it.  She shows fax to driver to give him the address, then settles back for
the trip.  Can take bottle of champagne resting in the limo bar.  We cut to
"Patti dreams of..." below.  Baltimore

[after leaving K-RAP]  If Patti has finished Phillie, she automatically
announces "Home, Bobbi!" to the driver.  Otherwise, she sets the DataMan to
Phillie, then shows DataMan to driver.  If no DataMan, can show fax to 
driver.  Can take bottle of champagne resting in the limo bar.  We cut to
"Patti dreams of..." below.  after Philadelphia

[after leaving des Rever]  If Patti has finished Baltimore, she automatically
announces "Home, Bobbi!" to the driver.  Otherwise, she sets the DataMan to
Baltimore, then shows DataMan to driver.  If no DataMan, can show fax to
driver.  Can take bottle of champagne resting in the limo bar.  We cut to
"Patti dreams of..." below.

                            Meanwhile... sequences 

Each "Meanwhile..." is framed in a dark frame.  It wipes in from the right,
shows its little cartoon, then wipes out from the left when done.  Start soon
after ride begins.  On each of Larry's trips to the airport (L. A., and after
each of his three women), instead of watching the entire ride, we interrupt
the ride to "take this opportunity to show you what's happening in..." 
Skippable via Fast Forward icon.  Upon return to limo, ride is slowing to a
stop.  

210   Meanwhile... Mob wants CANE 

Bigg discusses with his Mafioso henchmen how best to raise public anger
against A.S.H.V.  One suggests using a new, hyper-active, conservative
organization ("Conservatives Against Nearly Everything") to raise CANE 
against obscenity in rap music, suicide messages in heavy metal, and shock
DJs.  Bigg agrees they sound like  the perfect group to form the vanguard of
the protest against a filthy TV show.  Just a cut scene, then back to the
limo.  Reuse v122, v124.  

215   Meanwhile... McNasty on phone

Inset showing just McNasty on the telephone, listening deferentially to
someone he refers to only as "Julius."  He looks worried and assures him
everything is proceeding nicely.  Just a cut scene, then back to the limo.

220   Meanwhile... CANE gets a big grant

When CANE receives a sizable, anonymous donation to help its pursuit of porno
on TV, i.e., America's Sexiest Home Videos., the excitement spreads through
the hallways like the smell of their cheap hairspray!  Make 'em all look like
Jim Bakker.  (Except for Tammy!)  Just a cut scene, then back to the limo.

225   Meanwhile... CANE works Congress

CANE isn't letting its Mob "donation" go to waste.  We see them delivering
Halliburton suitcases full of money to their favorite, right-wing Congressman
on a bench under a tree right outside the U. S. Congress!  "I think you'll
know what to do with this sizable cash contribution to your 're-election'
campaign, Senator"  "Have I mentioned how much we want to see America's
Sexiest Home Videos off the air?"  "I thought so..." Just a cut scene, then
back to the limo.  


                                Patti Dreams of...  

The following three dream scenes take place while Patti is riding in the
limousine between gigs.  Dream "bubbles" appear near her head, swell to fill
the center of the screen, then we see each of the scenes below in that
bubble.  Following the scene, we fade to black, print "Meanwhile, an airliner
is preparing for its descent into %n." nextCityNameStr  There is no attempt
to "meld" the vision into the conclusion of Larry dream which follows. 
Patti's inventory leaves and Larry's comes back.  Fast Forward icon takes us
to start of next Larry segment.  

230   ...Donald Tramp's Yacht

Patti falls asleep and dreams of drifting with The Donald on his fabulous
yacht, The Tramp Pianist., enjoying the good life, performing Czerney on his
chest.  After this establishing long shot, we cut to...

232   ...Donald Tramp 2-shot

The Donald strokes Patti's hair with a diamond-encrusted, gold-plated,
sable-whisker hairbrush while she tickles his ivories.  The scene fades to
Larry landing.  

235   ...Wild Willy Gates

Patti dreams that she and Wild Willy Gates are lying on a huge, bedroom-sized,
circular waterbed with wavemachine attachment, their interesting parts
covered only by strategically-placed infrared Chiclet keyboards.  Willy
whispers romantic source code and major computer vender deals in her ear. 

240   ...Scrooge McDuck

Patti dreams of Scrooge McDuck driving a skiploader through his money bin,
picking up scoops full of money and showering it all over her naked body.  



                               Generic Airport

All of these pictures are reused in L. A., NYC, Miami, Atlantic City,
Washington, D.C.  All that changes is the addToPics of the city names and
humorous advertisements for local attractions on the walls.  "All airports 
look alike!"

There is a trash can waiting here.  (Look can says "Hold it till you get to
the can!")  If Larry telephoned the Green Card Corp. and made arrangements
for a card to be delivered, when he enters this scene he can look can and
find it waiting on the trash can.  He can take card, but he always "forgets"
to leave the money (since he has none!).

290   Chartreuse Carpet VIP lounge, empty

The Chartreuse Carpet VIP Lounge consists of four bare walls, a burned-dry
coffee pot, and a folding chair.  Barren, spartan, homely.  Exit only to
hallway and skyway.  "You feel out-of-place in such luxury."  Always the 
same.  Fortunately, it's always time to board.  The flight is announced, a
"Now Boarding" sign flashes over the jetway door in the rear wall, Larry
walks to the door, look door mentions a slot for boarding passes, and he 
applies his Boarding Pass to the ABM slot  The pass is retained by the
machine.  The door opens and he walks down the first class jetway to his
flight.  A continuously diminishing ego walks into the long tunnel and 
becomes a tiny speck before we change pictures to his first class seat.  Upon
his return, he becomes a steadily growing ego.  (An experience not wholly
unfamiliar to...)  Take pot, chair do nothing.  Click on chair walks Larry to
it, then does an EOL of ego sitting, falling backwards, rolling, standing up
while chair springs back up to normal position.  

This scene is the same in all airports until the very end of game after Larry
saves the airplane full of passengers.  Then it becomes...  

295   Chartreuse Carpet VIP lounge, full of reporters

Just a cartoon.  After saving the airliner, upon leaving the jetway Larry
finds the (now-expected, standard) VIP lounge completely full of reporters,
TV cameras, lights, boom mikes, etc.  As he enters, the room cheers.  Someone
thrusts a telephone into his hand and we an inset of the President.  He makes
the typical, after-theSuper-Bowl telephone call, congratulating Larry for
"saving the Vice-President's Mommy," and invites Larry to "a big State Dinner
in your honor, Mr. Laffter!"  Larry grins and accepts.  As the crowd goes
wild, children ask for autographs, and photographers seek in vain for a "good
angle", we iris in to black, then out on the big White House dinner party
long shot.  



                               Generic Airplane

Used whenever Larry travels to or from a city.  Always the same.  "Don't all
airplanes look alike?"  "Aerodork -the world's first all-automated
airline.  No messy humans to deal with!"  The usual airplane sequence is:  
"Jetway," "Takeoff," (possibly "U. S. A. Map,") "Sitting in First Class," "I
Dream of Patti," then game play as Patti until her dream sequence, then back
to "Sitting in First Class" to see Larry wake up with funny Pattidream
parallel, then "Landing," then "Jetway" at the next airport.  Fast Forward
icon always takes us to the start of the next important segment.  

310   Takeoff (also Landing)

This is just a cut scene.  Can be skipped with Fast Forward icon.  Extreme
long shot of tiny plane rising from runway.  

On takeoffs, come here from the "Jetway" scene.  If he took off from LAX or
has finished all three girls, we cut to the "U. S. A. Map" below.  If Larry's
flying between the East Coast cities, we skip the "U. S. A. Map" below and
instead, return to "Sitting in First Class."  Each takeoff has a slightly more
exaggerated, sillier animation.

For landings, come here from "wake-up in plane", watch plane land, then cut to
"V.I.P. Lounge" where we see Larry walk out of jetway.  Air traffic control
jokes.  Each landing has a slightly more exaggerated, sillier animation.  For
the final, Larry-controlled landing (after he saves the airliner), we show the
plane do several "bounce and goes."  Finally, Larry brings it in crosswise
(on the taxiway between runways), the plane "digs in its claws" and screeches
to a halt.  Larry comments, "What a stupid way to build an airport!!  Imagine
building a runway 50' long... and 2 miles wide!"

315   U. S. A. Map 

This is just a cut scene used to show (only two of) Larry's flights to and
from L. A.  All flights are straight.  After tracing about one-fourth the
route, cut back to "Sitting in First Class" and show Larry begin to doze.  

320   Sitting in First Class

This is just a cut scene.  Can be skipped with Fast Forward icon.  

[before dream]  This shows Larry sitting in his seat, with the magazine
visible in the seatback ahead of him.  His groin is hidden by the seat's
armrest.  He can take in-flight magazine from the seatback pocket for clues to
more difficult puzzles.  Clouds pass by occasionally while flying.  Otherwise,
the player just watches Larry begin to doze.  Larry's dream bubble appears
and grows to fill the center of the screen.  We shift to one of the "Larry
dreams of Patti" cartoons.  

[after Patti's dream]  Each Larry dreams ends with our return here, just in
time for a punchline.  Then we hear the "tighten seatbelts, we're landing"
speech and cut to "Landing" above.  Larry Dreams of Patti...  All of the
following dreams are just cut scenes.  Can be skipped with Fast Forward icon. 

[after "Sitting in First Class"]  Each scene appears in a cloud which is on
top of the "Sitting in First Class" scene above.  Each shows Larry's idyllic
vision of what Patti is now doing, then dissolves to the current, less-
than-idyllic "Patti reality" somewhere.  Position  the characters in the dream
so they can meld into the reality characters without movement.  Use same slow
dissolve as in "Patti dream sequences" in limo.  Show each of the following
Patti performance sequences just long enough for us to hear enough of the
music to know it's different each time.  Ultra-romantic, idealized, backlit
by moonlight, etc.  

Dreams appear in an order dictated by the choices the player makes as Patti. 
Athens always comes first to set up the "Piano Pit" sequence with the FBI. 
When Patti tells the driver to take her to Baltimore Larry dreams of Venice. 
When Patti heads for Philly Larry dreams of the Taj Mahal.  Casablanca always
occurs last.

[after Patti's dream]  After Patti's three dreams fade to black, we return
here to see Larry's vision of how his earlier dream of Patti is progressing. 
Each time something happens in his dream to wake him up, and provide material
for a gag; fortunately, just as the airplane is ready to land.  After seeing
the joke, we cut to "Landing," above.  

330   ...in Athens, reverse medium close-up

This dream always comes first, after "Take-off" from LAX.  Patti plays a
heavy, serious, classical piano recital featuring Romantic (with a capital R)
variations on the Larry Theme Song for a huge audience outside the 
Parthenon.  Patti in low-cut, high-slit, formal, black, floor-length,
ultra-sexy gown.  Black, 9', concert grand piano.  Audience formally dressed
(to the nines) visible behind her.  After hearing a few bars, we cut to...

335   ...in Athens, long shot

Long shot showing stage in far distance, large crowd stretching downhill
listening attentively.  Patti finishes her performance, rises and faces the
camera, and we cut to...

340   ...in Athens, reverse

We see Patti from the rear of the stage, bowing to a standing ovation from the
huge audience.  Much applause.  Roses thrown to the stage.  We dissolve to
"The Piano Pit" and the opening Patti cartoon.

345   ...after Athens

When Patti's dream is done, we fade to black, then return here.  We see a
continuation of Larry's dream of Patti, except now he's leaning against the
piano, she's leaning against him, he's rubbing her neck, her back, (Hey! He
unzipped the back of her dress!), her sides, and almost her chest.  We cut to
"Sitting in First Class" to see Larry's hands up in the air in front of him,
squeezing two backs of nuts.  The stewardess' voice says "Mr. Laffer, is
there a problem with your nuts?"  We cut to "Landing"

350   ...in Venice #1

This dream occurs if the player chose Baltimore as Patti's destination as he
was finishing the previous Patti segment.  We see a gondola float down a
Venetian canal under a bridge in the moonlight.  Gondolier is not visible. 
"You stick it in too deeply -an experience wholly unfamiliar to you!"  We
hear a few bars of some sensuous, Italian music, then cut to...

355   ...in Venice #2 (reuse for after Venice)

[before Patti]  Patti lies in the gondola beside the gondolier, who looks a
lot like Larry.  She gazes longingly at him, he returns her obviously strong
emotions.  The music builds to a fever pitch, setting up the following scene,
as we slowly dissolve to Patti's reality:  she's in the backseat, fending off
her limousine driver's advances...

[after Venice]  Following Patti's dream, we fade to black, then come here.  We
again see a gondola floating through Venice, but this time, after setting the
romantic mood again, it springs a leak right between Larry's legs, wetting
his pants just as we cut back to "Sitting in First Class," to see sleepy Larry
holding a dripping glass above his lap.  

370   ...at Taj Mahal

This dream occurs if the player chose Philadelphia as Patti's destination as
he was finishing the previous Patti segment  Patti plays rock and roll with a
strap-on keyboard synth by the reflecting pool of the Taj Mahal.  Other band
members nearly invisible.  The angle of the synth emphasizes her figure.  We
listen to a few bars of rock as we set up the following picture, then slowly
dissolve to the Patti reality showing Patti standing before the K-RAP
building.  

375   ...after Taj Mahal

Following Patti's dream, we fade to black, then come here.  We see Patti and
Larry inside the Taj Mahal, lying on some large, Indian cushions becoming
quite friendly.  Her synth rests nearby.  We see the concert site through the
window.  Patti plays an oboe, charming a cobra, causing it to rise from its
basket.  As we cut back to "Sitting in First Class," we see sleepy Larry's
meal slide off his tray table onto his ankles.  Since both of Larry's hands
are visible (but his groin isn't), we'll let the player's imagination
determine why Larry's face is so red!

380   ...Casablanca

This dream always occurs last, as Larry takes off for L. A.  We see Larry as
Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Patti as Elsa (Ingrid Bergmann) standing on the
tarmac in the fog with the DC-3 waiting in the background fog.  "Hill of
beans" speech.  We fade to the reality of Patti and Desmond standing in the
foggy alley outside the Piano Pit again, dressed in their respective trench
coats.  Use the tight 2-shot of Desmond and Patti so we can see lots of
Larry's face.

385   Dying in First Class

This is just a cut scene.  Can be skipped with Fast Forward icon.  Same as
"Sitting in First Class," but pivoted 90 degrees to indicate airplane
plummeting to earth.  The transition here is not like the other transitions;
it's sudden, obviously there's an emergency -something's wrong.  Boy, is
it!  An announcement requests "passengers with flight experience may wish to
report to the cockpit."  Since Larry once sold flight simulator software, he
volunteers.  The pilot's contract has just run out and he refuses to continue
flying the plane!  ("What!  No co-pilot?"  "Cost containment.  Do you think
prices as low as ours are an accident?"  "Yeah; an accident waiting to
happen!"  Pilot leaves carrying a parachute.) It seems the Vice-President's
Mommy is on the flight with Larry.  Cut to "Flight Stimulator" below.  

390   Flight Stimulator

A three-way split screen, showing an immense cockpit smothered with dials,
knobs, switches, gauges, CRT screens, etc. on the top half, a close-up view
of Larry panicking in the lower-left quarter of the screen, and a long shot
of the plane plummeting to Earth in the lower-right quarter.  Through some
tricky maneuvering (none of which works) plus accidentally catching his coat
sleeve on the controls (which does), Larry pulls the plane out of its spin,
saving the passengers.  He then lands it safely (by tripping on the rudder
pedals at just the right moment), and becomes a Big National Hero.  We cut
from here to "Takeoff/Landing" to watch Larry execute the actual landing. 
Hand on throttle moves throttle.  Hand on controls doesn't do much for a
while, then a click says "Your leisure suit catches on the steering wheel,
right the airplane."  In the exterior view window, we see the plane correct
its flight while in the Larry window, we see him smile.  "But now comes the 
hard part -you've got to land this thing!"  Cut to "Takeoff/Landing".  
Opening Patti cartoon

400   "The Piano Pit"

This is just a cut scene.  Fast Forward icon skips ahead to Desmond's office. 
We dissolve here from Larry's dream of Patti at the Parthenon.  Patti is just
finishing her last show at "The Piano Pit," a rather seedy jazz 
nightclub/sing-a-long piano bar in Georgetown, Virginia.  Show small club, few
customers, bored bartender in rear polishing glasses.  Pic should exactly
match Larry's dream pic, except surroundings are a dive.  Constants are: 
piano and Patti.  Variants are:  stone columns become drabby, dingy curtain
legs; roses on stage becomes napkins; patrons throw napkins at stage instead
of roses; huge audience becomes scattered drunks ignoring her.  Patti bows to
smattering of applause, then walks off the grimy little stage into the grimy
little office of the grimy little nightclub owner...  

405   Club Owner's Office

Small, tight, little, overcrowded, grimy office.  Framed picture.  Patti walks
in, sits sexily on a corner of desk.  He begins their conversation by firing
her!  It seems "Julius didn't much care for your small audiences; your fans
listen too much and drink too little"; how can he and "his backers" be
expected to make a profit like this?  Patti learns she's not getting stiffed
out of two weeks pay (again) and next week's gig is cancelled.  Under program
control, she leaves in disgust, returns to the stage, grabs her charts, and
walks out the back door into...  

410   Dark Alley Exterior 

A dark, film noire alley behind the club.  We can see "The Piano Pit" neon
sign flashing in distance.  Trashy, garbage, bottles stacked up.  Night. Mist
coming from manholes and basement windows.  Waiting for Patti in his trench
coat and slouch hat is FBI Inspector Desmond, who plays on her anger and
convinces her to help her country while getting even with the Mob.  Overlay
faces while conversing.  They walk off together through the mist to his
waiting car, into the foggy backlighting.  Film noire.  They walk off-screen
and we iris in, cover their short drive to FBI HQ through text, then iris out
to see Patti seated in Inspector Desmond's office.  

415   Dark Alley, 2-Shot

[opening cartoon]  Show lots of face for expressions, just Patti and Desmond
talking.  This pic must match the last Larry dream shot (Casablanca).  

[end of game] We dissolve into this scene from Larry's dream while heading to
L. A. on his final flight.  Patti and Desmond are Ingrid and Bogie.  This
time he is debriefing her.  She tells him all the Patti points the player
accomplished during the game.  If points were missed, Desmond suggests she
could have done more in "that area."  This is just a sneaky way to let the
player know where they missed points.  "And in appreciation of all you've
done, Patti, I want to assure that, true to my word, I've made all the
necessary arrangements, and you are officially on the bill as entertainment
at the very next White House dinner!"  "Oh, Paul!  I'm so happy.  Perhaps now
my career will finally take off!"  As he begins to explain the arrangements,
we are interrupted by the emergency on Larry's flight, and go immediately to
"Dying in First Class." "FBI Headquarters" -Washington, D. C.

420   Inspector Desmond's Office, 2-shot

This is just a cut scene.  Fast Forward icon skips ahead to just after Von
Pelt's office.  Patti is briefed by Inspector Desmond for her mission into
the dark side of the music biz.  Government office; nondescript.  Chair for
Patti to sit.  Desmond sits behind his desk to make his view smaller.  Like
all the cartoon sequences in this game, this can be bypassed by the Fast
Forward icon.  Desmond explains Patti's mission to her.  "You must go 
undercover to learn of any organized crime influences in the entertainment
industry.  Obtain sufficient evidence so the FBI can convict them and clean
up the business."  "Yes, but what area?  Crime is rampant."  "Specifically,
investigate subliminal messages in popular recordings and the recent spate of
obscene rap recordings.  We think some guy named Julius is involved with 2
Live Screw and K-RAP.  In return, we'll set you up with a tour as cover and
take care of all your travel arrangements.  First class, of course.  Yes, a
private limousine for your exclusive use.  Possibly even a White House gig if
things go well!"  Patti consents, "When do I start?"  Desmond tells her "Let
me introduce you to Commander Twit.  He'll fit you with everything you 
need."  We cut to "Commander Twit's workshop, West" below.

425   FBI exterior

Entered only from Laboratory.  Just a place for Patti to enter the limousine
or return to Commander Twit's Workshop thru "Stein Labs" door.  Backgrounds
should look Washington, D.C.-ish.  Patti can walk up to the limo, hand on
limo means we cut the limo interior to find her inside.  Typical city
storefronts, except with names revealing the type of offices within: 
"Gyno-Man -We Deliver!", "The Woodwind Repair Shop" and "Stein Laboratory
-We'll Be Frank With You."  

430   Commander Twit's workshop, West

Connects to r440 by scrolling.  There is a door here that takes us to the FBI
exterior, where we find the limo waiting in the street.  The door back into
Desmond's office is always locked.    

[opening cartoon]  Here's where we set up the joke for Dr. Von Pelt.  Very
techie laboratory.  Spoof of the James Bond movies' overly high-tech
gadgets.  Twit and Patti walk through this scene on her way to Von Pelt's 
office.  As they walk, Twit pauses at several tables to shows her gag spy
items.  "This is our new 'heat-seeking, ground-to-air vibrator'"  We show an
inset of the experiment, showing the agent turning on the vibrator but 
forgetting to let go.  The vibrator seeks the closest source of heat, heading
over his head, down his back and up his asshole.  He begins to shudder
violently and shakes his way out of the inset.  The second "is our 'hair-
trigger, armor-piercing brassiere.'  To fire it, merely touch your elbows
behind your back!"  The techie thinks Twit means him and now, so he does it. 
Another techie gets it!  He turns toward us, blinks, and slinks out of the
frame.  We return to the main picture to see Twit and Patti walk to Commander
Twit's workshop, East.

[after Pelt-ing]  A cartridge storage rack (i.e., bookshelf) stores many ROM
cartridges for the DataMan.  If she remembers the #'s given her by Twit, she
can find the corresponding carts for the two villains she's seeking.  take
Rom Cart puts them in inventory.  

440   Commander Twit's workshop, East

[opening cartoon]  The third techie is working on "high-yield, space-age
polymer, chemical flatulence powder suitable for destabilizing governments by
embarrassing a country's leader while at a major state functions!"  As he
speaks, the techie takes a drink and he swells like a Macy's parade balloon. 
We see him bouncing off the walls and disappear out of the inset.  "Possibly
a lighter dosage would be preferable!"  He stops at a computer to issue her
contact's telephone number (which she may dial with the limo's cell phone),
plus a bunch of fake funny spy knowledge she doesn't need:  computer account,
E-mail ID number, password, security clearance, codename ("Agent 88," of
course), etc.  He tells her she'll need an official departmental medical
checkup and "a fitting" for her "Safety First" Field Locator Device.  They end
up at the far end of the laboratory before a door labeled "Medical."  He
opens the door, introduces her to Dr. Von Pelt who tells her "Nice to meet
you.  Take off all your clothes!"  ("Fast worker," she thinks.)  "Assume the 
position," he smiles. "Oops, sorry; I used to be a field agent!"  She enters,
we see the door close, and we move to "Dr. Lyccus Von Pelt's Office" below.  

[after Pelt-ing]  Patti is standing outside the door to Von Pelt's office,
under player control.  The door back into Von Pelt's office is always
locked.    The hair-trigger bra is issued to her and added to inventory.  This
is the start of her portion of the game.  (We could also come here from a
Fast Forward during Patti's opening cartoon.)  She roams the lab tables
looking for stuff.  She finds the "DataMan" on the workbench beside a 
computer.  Take Dataman installs it in inventory.  

450   Dr. Lyccus Von Pelt's office

All takes place in opening cartoon.  Angle is from over Patti's head so we can
see a Patti-eye view of Dr. Von Pelt's head between her legs (which are
demurely covered by a sheet).  As he raises the sheet, a hint of a smile
crosses his lips.  "God, I love this job!!"  (Insert cavern, clam, and fish
jokes here.)  He inserts a metal probe, the screen shakes, he replies, "Oh,
sorry; let me warm that for you."  As he installs the device, she squirms. 
"Oh, sorry; perhaps something in a D-width?"  He brings out a syringe.  "Just
relax; you'll only feel a little prick."  (A feeling not wholly unfamiliar to
you!)  We iris in to black, print "two hours later..." then iris out to...

458   post-Pelting 

After Patti gets her "Locator" installed, we see von Pelt leaning back in his
chair with a cigarette.  He inhales, exhales, does a take to the player,
feels his head for his now-missing miner's helmet.  We cut to Patti outside 
his door in r440.



                               Closing Cartoon

460   White House Dinner long shot

This is a cut scene, skippable via the Fast Forward icon which takes the
player to "Helicoptering Into The Sunset" below.  We see the dais in the
back, with the two empty seats of honor near the Vice-President.  Patti is
seated near the entrance with Desmond, her date.  Mr. Bigg, the Mafioso
chieftain we met in our opening cartoon, is seated on the dais near the V.
P.  Larry is introduced last, makes his entrance, sees Patti, rushes to her. 
As they embrace, we cut to "Patti embraces Larry" below.  

[after "Patti embraces Larry"]  Patti & Desmond walk to the dais, followed by
Larry.  Since there are only two chairs, and Patti and Desmond grab them,
Larry is left standing.  A Secret Service agent walks in with a folding
chair, sets it up for Larry, and he squeezes between Quayle and Desmond.  So
now our dais line-up (from left-to-right) is Quayle, Larry (sideways),
Desmond, Patti and Bigg.  During dinner, Larry makes a few comments to Quayle
and Desmond, then Mr. Bigg leans over to Patti.  As they embrace, we cut to
"Bigg hustles Patti" below.  

[after "Bigg hustles Patti"]  Larry, eavesdropping, turns to Patti, "Wait a
minute, Patti.  Something's wrong.  He's offering you the job as hostess of
"America's Sexiest Home Videos!"  But he has nothing to do with that!  I was
sent to find... Say, unless you're the money behind...?"  

"JULIUS!" you cry, suddenly putting everything together!  "Desmond!  Arrest
this man!"  You finally realize where you heard that love song Bigg was
humming!  "That song!  I wrote that for the album I made in LSL4:  The
Missing Floppies!"  There's no way you could know that song unless you played
LSL4!  Those disks were stolen before they reached production  Of course, you
hired me to create the music, then erased the floppies to keep from paying
me!  No wonder my poor Larry has amnesia!!  Julius Bigg you are the man I've 
been chasing!"  

Bigg leaps to his feet, pulls a gun from his pocket and aims it at Desmond,
shouting "That's what you think!"  Larry thinks he's aiming at Quayle, cries,
"I'll save you, Sir!" and throws himself on top of the V. P., slamming his
face into the lemon merangue pie before him.  Patti turns to Bigg, touches her
elbows behind her back, her exploding bra does its thing, and Bigg is smoked
and stunned.  Desmond grabs the now-stunned Bigg, takes his gun, cuffs him
and leads him away, leaving Patti dateless.  Quayle rises from the pie, wiping
his face.  Larry looks embarrassed.

Patti turns to Larry, "So... it appears I'm free for the weekend?  How about
you?"  Quayle thinks she's talking to him and replies, "Er, uh, perhaps I
could set up a little excursion to Camp David..."  Larry assumes he's being
magnanimous, "Gee, thanks!  I hope you 'n the missus get a chance to come
along too.  You know, you've always been my personal hero!!"  Fade to
black...

470   Patti embraces Larry

Inset pic over the "Dinner Scene" above.  A passionate embrace, and a chance
for us to catch up with years of missing activity, including Larry's amnesia
and Patti's recent successes.  Restate positions:  Larry infatuated with
Patti; Patti indifferent but not disinterested.  Larry asks her if she'd like
to join him at the dais, "since I had a little trouble finding a date."  She
accepts, and without asking Larry, invites Desmond to come along as we return
to the previous pic.  

475   Bigg hustles Patti

A close-up of just Patti & Bigg.  Bigg is close to Patti's ear, obviously
trying to score.  Patti looks uneasy.  

"It's so fortunate that you're here this evening.  I'm only in town for a
short time.  Have to testify at that major Congressional hearing on
pornography in the entertainment industry .  You've heard about it, of course?
Yep, my job is to convince our U. S. Congress to create anti-pornographic
legislation tight enough to make the airwaves "Beaver" clean again, like in
the good ol' days!"  His breath curdles your hairspray.  You're unimpressed,
and decide to play hard to get.  He hums a little love song which sounds oddly
familiar to you.  Realizing you're unimpressed, he digs in deeper.  "You
know, Patti (may I call you Patti?), you're a very sexy woman.  In fact, I've
been looking for just such a woman for a new position I've created."  Again,
he hums that little tune.  "What is that melody?  Where have I heard it?" you
wonder.  "Patti, let me cut to the chase:  you seem like a woman interested
in success.  How would you like to be the hostess of a new TV show?  We were 
looking for the sexiest woman in America.  Say the word, and it will be you!" 
Finally, you respond, "Really, Mr. Bigg, your offers are not the least
bit..."  He interrupts you, "Oh, Patti!  Don't be so formal.  Just call me 
'Julius.'"  "JULIUS!" you think, your mind racing!

We cut back to the previous pic.

480   Helicoptering Into The Sunset

We cut to the White House lawn at sunset to see Marine Corps One take off from
the White House lawn and slowly disappear into the sunset, carrying Larry and
Patti away to spend a long weekend at Camp David with Larry's heroes:  the
Quayles.  

We wrap up all our loose ends through text over the lawn as the credits fade
in and out over the sunset.  "So, all's well that ends well?  Well, well!  We
learn all Larry's "work" was for naught as the ASHV producer "simplified the
auditions" by magnanimously awarding the show's hostess gig to his girl
friend; ASHV went on to become the megahit of the season; Bigg got off
scot-free after pleading insanity due to the high sugar content of White
House desserts; recordings no longer contain subliminal messages since kids
can't figure out how to play CDs backwards; the Mob's porn biz continued to
decrease; Congress never did get around to doing anything to clean up the
airwaves; the entertainment industry is only slightly more honest; and Leisure
Suit Larry and Passionate Patti are together again!"  "Hey, Larry," says
Patti feeling the bulge in Larry's leisure suit, "waddaya say we watch these
videotapes during the flight?"1.  



                    "The Hard Disk Cafe" -New York City

Here Larry finds Michelle Milken, noted Wall Street junk bond saleswoman and
financier.


500   "Hard Disk Cafe" exterior

Room for limousine.  Limousine drives off as soon as Larry exits it, so keep
it small.  Nothing else to do.  Walk on inside.  

[after Michelle]  Limo shows up here only after Larry telephones for it from
the HDC lobby telephone.  

510   Lobby

Courtesy (free, non-pay) telephone near maitre 'd.  Generic woman stands
talking on phone endlessly. Lobby decorated with computer memorabilia in
display cases both on the floor and mounted on the walls.  As Larry walks
toward the "museum" area, we cut to "Computer Memorabilia Close-up" below.  To
the other side an antique paper tape reader/puncher stands before a steel
gate. Talk man to maitre d' (whose last name is Frag) gives several
responses, but generally he treats Larry with respect.  He remembers him from
previous games (he worked at the resort in Larry2 and the casino of Larry3). 
When he requests a table, the maitre d' is unhelpful unless Larry applies
cash to man (from the supply in the DayTrotter), or talks man for quite a 
long while (several messages).  If Larry applies credit cards to man, Frag
says "save those, they may come in handy later."  Eventually, the maitre d'
consents to make Larry a membership tape from the old paper tape 
puncher/reader so Larry can gain admission to main dining room.  He works the
punch tape machine and it produces a short strip of paper computer tape,
which the maitre d' gives to Larry.  Apply tape to reader takes us to "Paper
Tape Reader Close-up" below.

After Larry watches Michelle enter the Hollerith room, he can return to the
lobby.  Talk man says he wants into private room.  Maitre d' mentions credit
cards.  If he has the DayTrotter, he can give him all the credit cards, Frag
makes him an improved tape (that still says Larry), and he can now enter
Hollerith room.  

[after MM]  We iris out to find Larry standing in front of the gate, without
his DayTrotter, credit card collection, cash, membership tape, or Michelle. 
Woman has finally stopped talking on telephone, so he can call the limousine
company to retreive him.  He walks outside, finds the limousine waiting,
enters, and arrives at LaGuardia, his mission accomplished.  

A Look at the display cases gives some information about them (probably
accurate, but inferring to keep looking) and a single-cell view of the
object.  Then he walks past a case with floppy disk, magnetic tape, paper 
tape, punch card, player piano roll, Jacquard loom card, and a music box. 
Again, a Look explains how these relate to modern computers.  The music box
is playable with the Hand, but it sounds like hell.  If he has the paper
membership tape, the message notices the music box's cylinder is the same
width as his paper tape.  If he applies tape to music box, cut to a small
window showing the tape wrapping around the cylinder, punching additional
holes in the tape.  "You may well have ruined your only chance at admission!" 

530   Paper Tape Reader Close-up

Shows mostly a computer monitor screen attached to the paper tape reader. 
Text should look old, dotty, 24column and all caps.  Need only enough
on-screen space to display Larry's name, User ID# number. This pic is used
both in the HDC lobby and cafe (at the entrance to the Herman Hollerith Room).

[in lobby]  "Processing..."  "Welcome, User. You are assigned to Track 68,
sector 4f."  Cut back to Lobby scene, see gate swing open, and Larry enter
the cafe under program control.

[in cafe]  "Processing..."  If plain paper tape, "Your clearance level
prevents access.  Assigned to Track 68, sector 4f."  If "improved" tape from
music box, "WELCOME, Gilbert Hyatt.  Sit anywhere!"  If "upgraded tape" from
maitre d', "Welcome, SuperUser Laffer.  Access approved."  After either of
these, we cut back to Cafe pic, watch the rear door swing open, and Larry
enter the private room under program control.  

540   The Cafe

Tables are arranged in very straight, symmetrical rows and columns, numbered
by track and sector.  Tables stretch off-screen to left and right, implying a
much bigger room.  Looks like inside of a hard disk.  Door labeled "The
Herman Hollerith Room."  Larry is assigned to "track 68, sector 4f".  Some
tables have "Reserved:  system" signs.  Nothing happens until Larry sits at
his assigned table to wait for Michelle Milken.  Michelle won't show up until
Larry sits down.  When he does, we prevent Larry from rising, she enters,
passes near Larry's table, Larry recognizes her, tries to stop her by saying
something, but she brushes past him, ignoring him completely to enter the
door at the rear of the room.  Once Michelle's through the door, Larry can
stand.  If he inserts his tape at the door, we cut to the "Paper Tape Reader
Close-up" above.  

550   "The Herman Hollerith Room"

Private dining room, intimate setting.  Dark walls, candlelight, expensive
crystal, linen, silver.  Only a very few tables, all couples closely involved
with each other, except for Michelle Milken who dines alone in a rather 
enclosed booth.  Near her booth is the only empty table, a serving cart for
one which Larry automatically walks to and sits down at upon entering the
room.  They are the only two dining alone.  Talk girl lets him strike up a 
conversation with her.  She remains uninterested and unimpressed until Larry
eventually expresses interest in junk bonds or he shows her his DayTimer. 
Then she expresses interest in obtaining his money!  She invites him to join
her in her booth.  After he sits, we cut to her close-up below.  

560   Michelle Milken close-up #1

[first time]  "I laugh all the way to and from the bank!"  She has already
ordered desert ("la tubular du juor") and as they converse, she slowly and
seductively eats it.  She begins by dipping her index finger into the whipped
cream, then sucking it off ("Don't you just love stiff cream?").  Larry
discusses computers, games, and financial security.  Choosing the financial
answer makes progress.  If give DayTrotter to her, she uses her 18" tongue to
snap off the sundae's cherry without moving her head.  She becomes convinced
that Larry's a rich eccentric with much money to invest.  She suggests they
make their booth more private so they can talk "financial affairs."  We
return to the long shot of the restaurant, see the other customers have left,
watch MM reach up and draw the curtain across their booth, then return to... 

565   Michelle Milken close-up #2

[after curtains closed]  Michelle goes down on her sundae, sucking the ice
cream from the dish, then sits up, leaving the banana standing erect in the
dish.  Even Larry gets her drift.  (Lower filth levels skip this.)  She then
"shoulder walks" her way down the booth, disappearing under the table. 
Somewhere during this sequence Larry should start the pocket camcorder
running to record the "blow-by-blow" action, following the instructions in
the game's documentation.  FF skips this scene, taking the player to "HDC
Lobby, after MM."

570   Larry close-up

Shot from behind Michelle, showing Larry's upper body at the table.  Larry's
head must be large enough so we can see good facial reactions.  Michelle
finds out Larry used to be in software.  "How would you like me to download
onto your hard disk?"  she sighs as she slowly slides beneath the tablecloth
while discussing the relative merits of insured versus uninsured bond(age). 
Larry's eyes glance downwards, then roll back in his head.  He gasps, he
smiles, he does lots of facial takes.  As his eyes roll back in his head, we
discretely iris in to black, then iris out on Larry standing in the HDC lobby
without his DayTrotter, credit cards, membership tape or money except the
quarters he needs to use the phone.  FF to skip this scene.



                      "The Shill Building" -Baltimore


600   Backseat Patti

FF skips this scene, taking the player to outside the limo.  We dissolve into
this scene from Larry's "Patti in Venice" dream.  The reality is, she has
arrived in Baltimore and must fend off her limousine driver's backseat 
advances.  Common elements in the two pictures are:  Patti and driver.  We
only watch a few seconds (in which his advances are not too strenuous). 
Struggling to get away from the driver, she exits the limousine still under
program control to stand in front of the...

610   "The Shill Building" Exterior

Limousine waits for Patti to return, so she can leave building at any time and
head off for the next city.  Revolving door.  (Is this the only type of door
we haven't done yet!?)  Tall building in midst of other tall buildings. 
Granite, brass and chrome exterior.  

620   Shill Building Lobby

A guard sits at a table preventing entrance to elevator without destination. 
Wall holds directory with list of tenants.  Look board cuts to "Building
Directory" below, then returns here. 

Talk guard gets a request for destination.  Talk guard (if Patti has learned
office number from DataMan or fax transmission) or Apply DataMan to guard (if
set to record company) makes him call ahead for approval.  Guard says they're
waiting for her piano cut-in session.  He gets it, summons elevator (all
without leaving his desk since he has no legs), elevator doors open, Patti
enters under program control and she automatically goes to destination floor
only.  We never see inside the elevator -after its doors close in the lobby,
we cut to the doors opening in the lobby of des Rever Records.  

630   Building Directory

Close-up of directory on wall of lobby.  Patti can read the office number of
des Rever Records.  The board uses those push-in letters and some letters are
missing from some names (creating humorous spellings).  When she uses hand on
the name of the record company, we give a message that she gives the guard her
destination, then we cut back to her standing before the board in the lobby
pic.  _uck Corp, Hell_ Industries, des Rever Records, etc.

640   des Rever Records Waiting Room

The office walls are mostly glass, which generates some nice 3-D effects.  The
lobby connects the recording studios, control rooms, and offices.  It also
contains a record player with turntable, amp, speakers, and a gold record
mounted on wall.  Take gold record adds it to inventory.  Look stereo cuts to
"Stereo Close-up" below.  As she nears Studio A at the top of the pic, she
hears a speaker crackle, "Come into the studio, Patti.  I'm waiting for
you."  Hand on door takes her to "Recording Studio" below.

650   Stereo Close-up

Draw at whatever angle will minimize size of animation necessary.  Patti can
apply record to turntable.  Switch labeled "R OFF F".  Hand moves switch to F
play record forward,  or "R" for Reverse.  Speed indicator labeled 33, 45,
78.  Show record spin, hand on arm places tonearm on record, hand on speed
indicator changes speeds.  It sounds fine at 33 Forward.  At 78 F, she hears
"DAT causes impotence."  (Hmm.  Must be a preSony CBS recording.)  At 78 R,
she hears "Porn is best at a quarter a whack!"  At 33 R she hears, "Just Do 
Drugs."  She keeps the gold record for evidence.  Each of these will check for
DAC support; if there, no print window, and you'll hear the actual,
funny-sounding, backwards-ish speech.  

660   Recording Studio

Lots of drums, mike stands, speakers, and a view of the control room through a
window on the rear wall.  There is a door to control room beside window. Upon
entering this scene, Patti remembers her last studio session, a big 2-album
recording of background music for a computer game named "Larry4."  How she
left Larry programming his heart out in the mountains.  And that big contract
with a mysterious someone named "Julius" who never paid her one red cent! She
grimaces and hopes this session goes better.  

Reverse Biaz introduces himself as "chief engineer and specialist in backwards
subliminal message recording."  He tells her through the talkback speaker the
synth is programmed, the charts are on the music stand, the levels are
checked and he's "ready when she is!"  She can't enter the control room yet. 
All she can do is sit at the synth keyboard.  When she does, we cut to the
"Synth Close-up" below.  

[after "Synth Close-up"]  Under program control, Patti leaves the keyboard and
walks to the control room.  This time the door opens automatically, she
enters, and we cut back to the "Synth Close-up" below.

670   Synth Close-up 

[first time]  Show just part of a synth keyboard and some music.  We see the
announcement, "Take 1," we hear the music starts, and the player must click
the hand on keys of the on-screen piano keyboard at approximately the right
time to complete the recording.  It will probably take at least several takes.
(If they try more than 5 times and can't do it, we'll just cheat and do it
for them.)  Reverse is encouraging when possible.  After a good take, he
invites her into the control room to hear the playback.  We return to
"Recording Studio" above.  

[after Patti enters control room]  Reverse rolls tape, they listen to her
recording, he compliments her on her playing and speculates "you must have
wonderful technique."  If she apply champagne to man, he drinks it all, gets
drunk quickly and chatters aimlessly, eventually giving her his tape to
impress her.  No sex, the clean and simple solution.  After she gets the
evidence she needs (or after n minutes with him), we wipe in the "Meanwhile"
below.

If instead, she talks man, she questions him about his success in the biz. 
Eventually (slowly, more dialogue), he mentions his speciality is backwards
subliminal message recording and how good business has been lately.  Once
she's heard the evidence she needs, if she talk more, she asks him for some
samples of his work for her collection.  He says he'll gladly give her some
samples of his work if she'll give him some samples of her work!  Eager to
"serve her country" (especially with such a hunk), she consents and we
discretely cut back to the recording room pic, where we see her and Reverse
get it on through the window.  During their passion, Patti accidently hits
the Record button with her foot, recording their lovemaking.  Later, Reverse
adds a simple drum track and a synth bass part.  At last Patti has a hit
record!  (She just doesn't know it!)  More points this way.  After she gets
the evidence she needs (or after n minutes with him), we wipe in the
"Meanwhile" below.

690   Meanwhile... Back at the FBI #1

We come here upon Patti's departure in the limo from K-RAP radio.  We see a
couple of FBI types huddled over a radar screen with a blip flashing away. 
"What's she doing now?" asks the boss.  "I dunno; it's hard to make out. 
She's either in a tunnel near Baltimore, or she's dilated 3 cm!"  



                       "Tramp Casino" -Atlantic City

Larry finds Lana Luscious, his second girl, here.  Everything in town is named
for Donald Tramp, a formerly rich guy.  


700   "Tramp Casino" Exterior

Shows some surf (for Larry to walk out of when he falls off the boardwalk). 
He can walk into water and start swimming.  (For this game, polyester sheds
water.)  He can walk from water onto the shore, driveway, boardwalk. 
Boardwalk begins on the right.  Casino entrance.  Casino building
"architecture by Frank Lloyd Wrong" (the bizarre-r, the better).  As soon as
Larry leaves his limousine, it pulls away.  Doorman and scantily-clad woman
stand on either side of casino entrance.  If he's on rollerblades, he can't
skate off the boardwalk area.  

Doorman not very interactive.  Talk doorman response is "May I summon a
limousine for you?"  Yes/no buttons to click response.  

Woman very interactive, asking passersby "Hey, wanna get lucky?  Guess the
number of which I'm thinking of."  Talk girl dialog prompts, "Between 1 and
6900..." and gives him buttons to click, a la pushbutton phone dial.  If 
Larry has no money, he always "picks" right, so he has a dollar to play video
poker.  Any time he has money, he guesses wrong!  (What are the odds, you
ask?  See, the game is rigged, ok?)  "No, sorry.  I was thinking of %d!"  

[after LL]  Silver Dollar girl not here.  Talk doorman, asks him to summon a
limousine.  He then automatically tips the doorman ALL of his remaining
silver dollars.  The limo comes, Larry enters, and exits scene under program
control.  

710   "Tramp Casino" Interior, Extreme Downshot

The main room of the casino proper is an easy, silly maze, filled with many
different types of gambling, but only the video poker machines are accessible
to Larry.  The path through the maze is obvious, just fun.  Exit S to
boardwalk and N to ballroom.  People are gambling at other machines, but no
one gambles at any poker machine.  Apply silver dollar to machine anywhere
along the many tables of video poker machines takes us to "Video Poker Arcade
Game" below.  

When return from poker, show Larry standing at same position from which he
left.

720   "Tramp Casino" Video Poker 

"The Pete Rose Model"  Authentic gambling, just like real draw poker machines
in Vegas.  On-screen buttons control play.  Use silver dollar on slot inserts
all  of player's money into the machine.  You can then bet from 1-100 dollars
or withdraw your winnings at any time.  Up your bet by repeated clicks.  Click
cash out button to claim winnings also automatically exits the picture. 
Losing all money also exits the picture.  Player can win up to $25,000. 
Jackpot continually changes to $25000, minus his dollars.  Winning jackpot
also exits the picture.  Save/restore disabled in this scene (maybe?  is this
a good idea??)

Multiply amount bet times these odds:  Straight Flush=100; 4 of a kind=50;
Full House=25; Flush=20; Straight=15; 3 of a kind=10; 2 pair=5; 1 pair of
jacks or better=2.  Royal Flush payoff is progressive; it starts at $1000 and
adds 1 each play.  

730   "Tramp Casino" Ballroom

Home of the"Tramp This! Wet T-Shirt Contest."  Until Larry meets Lana on the
boardwalk, this room contains only a wet T-shirt contest.  (Only!?)  Just a
little T&A to keep Larry busy until the mud wrestling starts.  After they
speak and she offers to meet him in the ring, he returns here to enter her
mud-wrestling contest.  After mud-wrestling, the ballroom is closed.  Runway
leads off-screen right so girls have a place to enter/exit.  Aisle leads to
stage from bouncer.  Dramatic show-biz stage lighting.  Try to reuse same pic
for both ballroom scenes with as little variation as possible.  

[wet T-shirt contest]  A bouncer collects the $25 cover charge via money on
bouncer.  Larry can enter anytime, sit and watch any length of time and leave
anytime.  There's a never-ending supply of women.  Nothing else happens.  

In the CD-ROM version we'll include lots of close-ups of great women.  Girls
parade on, get to center, we cut to close-ups, some large without animation,
smaller with more animation.  Art department contest for sexiest pictures? 
(No point, just a chance to show pictures of wet, titillating women.  Ain't
that why God made VGA? Besides, I thought we'd all want to be there for the
CD-ROM photo shoot!)  

[Mud Wrestling Sequence]  "Welcome to the "Tramp This! Mud Night Madness" mud
wrestling contest."  Once Larry has met Lana, when he returns to the
ballroom, instead of the T-shirt contest, he finds this.  In the CDROM
version we'll include lots of close-ups of mud wrestling bodies.  

Same bouncer is in foreground, preventing entrance without paying.  If Larry
applies money to the bouncer, he gets a choice of buttons to click:  $25 to
watch, $500 to participate.  If Larry gives him $25, he sits down under 
program control, Lana Luscious enters, stands in the middle of the ring,
taunts him, urging "a real man" to "come on up!"  If he gives the bouncer
$500 to participate, he heads up the stairs into the ring (vat? pen?).  Lana
attacks him immediately!  We cut to "Mud Wrestling 'arcade game'" below.  To
get maximum points, Larry must turn on the camcorder before entering ring.  

738   "Tramp Casino" Ballroom--wet T-shirt contestant

Just a T&A close-up.  No interaction.  anyEvent exits here and returns Larry
to standing outside the Ballroom entrance in the "Casino Interior."

740   Mud Wrestling "arcade game"

We get another pseudo-arcade sequence.  Female body parts appear on screen
with the instructions "Grab whatever you can!"  Sometimes as the player moves
near, a part will disappear and another part appears.  Mostly they're arms
and legs and necks and shoulders, but occasionally as the player moves close
to click on one it changes beneath his cursor to a more intimate body part. 
Or, a "good part" will appear far from the player's cursor, then change when
he gets close.  This is just all a smokescreen, since about all that really 
matters is how often the player clicks the mouse and the number of seconds
we've been wrestling.  It should only "feel" like the user is controlling
Larry's actions.  So, this should be arcade-feeling, but without that arcade 
pain.  Soon Lana climbs on top of Larry and appears to be winning, but no
matter how badly the player plays, eventually Larry flips her over onto her
back, and spreads out on top of her going for the "pin."  We soon cut to the
"Medium Shot" below.  

750   Mud Wrestling Medium Shot

The pic is set up so Larry and Lana can roll off the far side of the ring and
be in full view of the audience, yet not visible to us.  (Perhaps do
something with shadows on the audience?)  Audience members must be large 
enough so we can see their reactions to what they see.  

We begin this scene in missionary mode.  She squirms, he squirms, they
squirms, suddenly there's squirms everywhere!  They both breath heavily,
moaning sounds emanate from the CD-ROM drive, and they move ever more slowly
and subtly, eventually rolling off the far edge of the stage just as things
get good, landing on the floor at the feet of the front-row patrons.  We see
the audience's eyes widen, we see muddy clothes fly, but for a few seconds we
see nothing of Larry and Lana.  Then Lana sits up, Larry sits up, they both
glance down at Larry's member and Larry says, "Uh, I dunno, Lana.  Bucephalus
has never performed in front of 900 people before!"  We get a few laughs,
iris in to black, then iris out on Larry outside the casino entrance.  

760   Tramp Boardwalk

This scene actually stretches off to the east an infinite number of rooms
(well, maybe 32,767? 16? 8?), but is made up of just one pic to which we add
multiple, random addToPics so each scene seems different.  Frame is mostly
filled with boardwalk.  We use 5 different ego sizes here depending upon
Y-coordinate (plus 5 more skating egos).  Each scene has at least one bench. 
Pictures continuously scroll sideways.  There is no way to reach the right
(ocean) end of the boardwalk.  Show various shops, all closed, except for the
rollerblade shop which is always open.  Guys skate by, of no interest.  One
girl skates by, of big interest.  The game announces, "it's the girl you've
been looking for!"  

Larry can walk off the near edge only.  If he falls into water, he doesn't
tumble, instead he does a Wily Coyotetake, looking at the player before he
"zips" down.  There is a slight pause, then a splash.  We cut to the "Piling"
scene below.  While skating, we prevent him from falling off the edge with a
funny, out-of-balance loop.  Picture #8 will have pylons added to the middle
area.  If Larry can skate through them, he gets 5 points

The rollerblade rental shop is always in the fourth picture from the left. 
Hand on door lets Larry enter shop, and we cut to "Rollerblade Shop" below. 
Upon his return from the shop, if he rented successfully, he's on skates, and
we use a funny setSize cycleTime combination.  Learning to skate takes time. 
Keep track of cumulative skate time while on the rollerblades and moving.  At
first, he's quite unstable.  Eventually he learns, but only if he keeps
moving.  Perhaps we'll add tricks, jumps, spins, other cute animation to
impress the chick when the project is ready to ship early.  

After he's learned how to rollerblade, we add Lana Luscious to the scene.  She
skates a little slower than Larry so he can catch her.  If he does catch her
(defined as skating n  pixels from her), they stop, he talks to her, she
suggests they head for that nearby bench and rest.  If he uses Silver Dollars
on boardwalk near her; she'll stop skating to return them to him, then accept
his automatic offer to sit down and rest a while.  They skate to the nearby
bench together under program control and we cut to "Lana Luscious Close-up"
below.  [after Close-up]  Lana rises from the bench and rollerblades off
toward the casino.  Larry can't catch her, and she never appears here again. 
He returns the rollerblades to the rental shop (if necessary) and heads for
the casino ballroom.  

780   Under the Boardwalk

A pic with just pilings and water, reused over and over.  He must swim left
(towards land) as many screens as he's walked right but never more than ?? (8
??).  He ends up at the boardwalk entrance none the worse for wear.  

790   Ivana Tramp's Rollerblade Rental Shop

Tiny shop, dark, dank, with photos of skaters and posters of rollerblades on
walls, shelves in back, cloth drape serves as door to storeroom, no access
behind counter.  Chair for Larry to take off shoes, put on rollerblades.  
Bare bulb dangling from a wire from the ceiling provides the only light, other
than sunlight shining in the door at bottom.  Larry needs 250 silver dollars
for rental and deposit in order to rent rollerblades here.  Talk clerk says
she needs deposit.  Money on clerk gives it to her.  Or camcorder on clerk
leaves it as deposit.  He sits on the only stool, removes his shoes, puts on
the rollerblades, leaves his shoes there, and wobbles off screen to the 
boardwalk.  

[after skating]  Talk clerk responds "So ya gonna take off them skates?"  Hand
on skates walks Larry to seat.  Give rollerblades to clerk makes owner find
some damage "so I'll have to dock your refund %d bucks.  Thanks for skating
with Tramp!" random(100, 250)  Money and skates removed from inventory.  

795   Lana Luscious Close-up

Lana Luscious, once a beauty pageant runner-up, wet T-shirt contest entrant,
and ditsy blonde, is now a casino change girl/mud wrestler.  Lana tells him
her hopes and dreams, her wishes and desires, her ambitions and fantasies,
but mostly just invites him to the big mud-wrestling tournament that begins
shortly back at the casino ballroom.  Mostly they just chat here, but soon
Lana mentions she has to leave, as she's participating in the big mud
wrestling contest.  No fool, Larry agrees to meet her there.  We cut back to
the "Boardwalk" pic.  No alternate solution.  Hell, this ain't even a puzzle!



                       "K-RAP radio" -Philadelphia

This entire region takes place at night, the only one to do so.  


800   "K-RAP Radio" Exterior

Normal-scale pic showing just top story of huge building  visible in the
"K-RAP Exterior Reverse Long Shot" picture (from this angle it just looks
like a small building), with reverse of the bottom portion of a few letters 
from the big sign.  K-RAP in gold lettering on each of four doors.  Door
handle pairs say "96", their frequency.  External loudspeakers air their
current broadcast.  Limo can be fixed in position in this pic, as it never
leaves.  Hand on door to enter.  Hand on limo to enter limo and leave. 

[from Larry's dream of Taj Mahal]  Patti is already standing outside her
limousine in front of K-RAP Radio in Philadelphia, listening to a broadcast
over its exterior speakers of an advertisement for The Taj Mahal Cafe.  
Common elements between the two pictures are:  the band, the speakers, Patti. 
She walks inside under program control while the limo waits.  Instead of
immediately following her into the building, we cut to "KRAP Exterior
Reverse Long Shot" below.  

[from interior]  Limo is always waiting.  Patti can enter and leave at any
time.  

810   "K-RAP Radio" Exterior, Reverse Long Shot

Just a cut scene.  Only come here if it's Patti's first time in K-RAP.  Can
skip with Fast Forward.  From this angle, we can see there is much more to
K-RAP than shown in the previous "entrance" pic.  Trendy, hillside, 
multi-story building with logo flashing "K", "RAP", "K-RAP" on roof.  The top
floor was merely a small part of the entire structure, which stretches down a
long hillside in a series of rooftop patios.  From drive, she could only see
top story.  We can see the entire, large, pyramid-shaped structure, with
offices opening onto rooftop courtyards, hot tubs, gardens, tennis courts,
putting greens, etc.  Blinking aircraft lights pass in distance.  We get just
enough time to drink in the scene before we cut to...

820   "K-RAP Radio" Lobby

Rear wall shows roof top garden overlooking city lights.  Great view of the
city at night.  Terminally modern architecture.  Patti finds a bank of
elevators, an unattended receptionist's desk, and the office door of Mr. John
Krapper, Founder, Owner, President and C. E. O. of K-RAP Radio.  His office is
secured with a keypad lock.  look keypad or hand on keypad cuts to Lock
Close-up below.

830   Keypad Close-up

Very similar to telephone touch-tone dial.  Re-use code.  Rip off Sierra's
door keypads.  Keypad says "K-RAP 96 FM"  Need an "Exit" button.

[at Krapper's door]  Patti refers to her DataMan, learns the combination,
enters it into the keypad, we cut back to the lobby, watch the office door
swing open and see her enter.  As she enters, "You hear footsteps!  Hurry, 
Patti!  It's the receptionist returning from break."  

[at anywhere except Control Room B]  She doesn't know the combination, so
nothing ever happens.  

[at Control Room B]  She must enter the combination she learned in Krapper's
desk.  Randomly generated each game.  

840   John Krapper's Office

Rear wall is again all glass, overlooking city lights.  (reuse background from
lobby pic?)  Many computer terminals, tv monitors, stereo speakers, awards. 
Door to lobby.  Door to bath.  Weird spotlights create pools of light,
leaving portions of room in darkness.  Patti changes from dark to light as she
walks around the office.  Use both a dark and light ego here.  Desk is
locked.  She can't leave by the front door (hand on door responds, "the
receptionist has returned").  The desk, plant and copier are all spotlighted
in individual pools of light.  (Geez, is that obvious, or what?) 

Look desk responds, "There's a needle-sharp letter opener."   hand on desk
takes letter opener.  look plant responds, "There's a glint of metal in the
humus."  look plant again responds, "It's a key."  Hand on plant to take key.

opener on desk or key on desk lets Patti (pick) open the desk's lock and open
the desk drawer.  Inside the desk, look drawer responds, "Look:  a number! 
%d"  random(10000, 65000) generated each game and saved.  This is the code to
enter control room B's keypad door lock.  Another look desk (or for less
points, hand on desk as if to close drawer) responds, "You find a folder
marked 'Personal.'"  Later, look folder from inventory shows an incriminating
memo to Krapper from someone named "Julius".  A personal copier rests on the
table.   

If Patti tries to take anything out of the room, the game won't let her leave.
("He'll surely miss that %s, Patti!  Better return it." objNameStr)  She must
do open on desk, key on plant, folder on desk before leaving the room.  She
can apply folder to copier to use his photocopier to make copies of the file. 
Just as the copies are finished, the machine jams, she automatically opens
it, and toner explodes everywhere, turning her into Blackface Patti.  Another
two views (light and dark blackface) are necessary for her.  She must still
return everything where she got it (retaining just the copies).

850   John Krapper's bathroom

Toilet, sinks, shower. Gold fixtures.  Gold sinks.  Marble.  Granite benches. 
More dramatic lighting.  Glass walled elevator is disguised as a shower
stall, multi-nozzle, gold frame, 96 on door handles, hooks for clothes on
outside.  hand on toilet lets her "use toilet," but it's angled so when she
does, we see nothing interesting.  She notices the "shower" in his bathroom. 
If she is not dirty, she can't enter the shower. ("You don't need a shower
right now, Patti.  You're not dirty."  "(That is, you're not soiled!)")  Only
after she's covered with toner, does hand on shower start this program
control sequence.  She removes her clothing, hangs it on a nearby hook,
climbs in the shower very naked, hidden only by selective pixels of towel
rack, etc.  She turns the "faucet" and the "shower" lowers through the floor,
leaving her clothes behind.  She descends into... 

860   "K-RAP Radio" Atrium

At first, we see just the many floors full of offices, with people working at
desks, computers, etc.  A tiny shower descends through the pic (at the near
edge) so we can see the maximum effect of all the people gawking at Patti
naked.  ("Patti!  You're so em'bare-assed!!")  As she goes by, heads keep
popping up into windows, and turning toward her.  Make it look like the S. F.
Hyatt Hotel lobby.  She is still naked and blackfaced and blackhanded.  Draw
pic carefully so we can reuse the same yuppie workers in every window.  FF
skips this scene.  She descends into... 

870   "K-RAP Radio" Studios

There is a keypad (for which she has no combination) that prevents Patti from
re-entering the shower/elevator.  Soundproof glass and cubicle walls create
many offices, inside which we see desks, tables, phones, lounge chairs, etc. 
Each has at least two people conversing.  Everyone is dressed as a rapper.  
Everyone is black.  No one notices Patti.  She can roam around here, and
realizes she should probably listen to their conversations, but she can't
hear them through the soundproof walls.  She finds 2 Live 2 Screw meeting in 
the largest cubicle.  She feels certain their conversations would be revealing
to her mission.  ("If you could only hear through those soundproof
windows!")  

[first time here]  After a few seconds, we see Patti's elevator lower into
this pic, dropping behind a wall that makes it look like an elevator should. 
A hook on the wall between her elevator and another door labeled "Racquetball
Court #29" holds an M. C. Hammer-style rapper's outfit.  After the elevator
stops, hand on clothes makes Patti grab it, wear it, and she is instantly
transformed into "Rappin' Patti P."  She exits the elevator and with her hip
clothes and her newly-black skin, she may now wander the downstairs area with
impunity.  Hand on doors says they are locked, or there's a meeting inside. 
look keypad or hand on keypad takes you to the keypad close-up, but since you
don't know any codes, nothing happens.  

880   "K-RAP Radio" Control Rooms A & B

Two control rooms, mostly glass, plus other inaccessible rooms.  Room A is
occupied by P. C. Hammer, B is accessible to Patti, but locked.  Hand on
doors says they are locked.  Look door A says "there's a man inside."  look
keypad or hand on keypad takes you to the keypad, but you don't know any
codes, so nothing happens.  

[Before entering B]  look keypad or hand on keypad by either door takes you to
the "Keypad Close-up" above.  Patti uses the combination she learned
upstairs, we return here under program control, watch her unlock Control Room
B, enter, close the door, and we cut to "Control Room B" below.  

[from B, after starting tape recording]  A short cartoon interlude.  Skippable
via FF.  We return to this scene and see P. C. Hammer in Control Room A and
Patti in B.  P. C. observes Patti's spying, deduces what she's doing, and
that she's no rapper.  We see him leave Control Room A, walk to Control Room
B's door, and block it with a huge mike stand resting nearby.  Patti is
trapped in Control Room B!  He then leaves the scene, presumably to get
help!  We return to "Control Room B" below.  

890   Inside Control Room B

Here Patti finds a microphone, a reel of recording tape, dozens of knobs,
sliders, and meters, plus a few usable pushbuttons labeled with the names of
various offices.  

[first time]  She can take reel of recording tape from a shelf.  Tape on
recorder places tape on recorder.  Hand on recorder starts it recording. Hand
on mixer lets her hear the conversations in the other small studio-offices.  
As soon as she solves this puzzle and begins to record 2 Live 2 Screw, we cut
back to the "Control Rooms" above.  

[after she's locked inside]  Use mike makes her sing powerful high "C" and we
see the glass walls shatter!  



                 "Doc Pulliam's Dental Hygiene Heaven" -Miami

Larry finds his third girl here:  Chi Chi Lambada, a petite, gymnast, sexy,
lithe, beautiful, fiery, Latin, labadadancing, chili pepper of a dental
hygienist who has some really great moves.  


900   "Doc Pulliam's Dental Hygiene Heaven" Exterior

"Look for us under the giant revolving neon tooth!"  "Doc Pulliam"  ("That's
pronounced 'pull-'em'")  "Beats a string and a doorknob!"  Another sign
advertises the "Gym-Dandy Gymnastics Center"  located on the first floor 
directly beneath Doc Pulliam's office.  We can see the Gymnastics center has
partially open venetian blinds on its windows and a locked door.  Waiting
room is up an exterior flight of wrought iron stairs.  Room for limousine,
etc. as in other exteriors.  His limousine discharges him and leaves.  Just an
entrance.  Make background look like Miami.  

[after ChiChi]  Larry stands outside gymnastics door.  Door still locked.  He
must climb the stairs, enter the dental office to use the telephone to order
a limousine to take him back to the airport.

910   Dental Office Waiting Room

Very small waiting room, a few chairs (all of which fit the same Larry sitting
loop), a table with a doily on it, some old magazines (jokes about WWII, etc)
and a telephone.  Larry can sit on any chair, but they're all hard and
uncomfortable.  A receptionist sits behind a typical sliding window on wall
next to a door that leads to office proper.  We can only see part of her
head.  

Look window says the fine print says to "open window for service." Hand on
window makes the window slide open, the "helpful" receptionist introduce
herself, she asks him a series of yes/no questions:  insurance? allergic to
pain? fear of rubber in your mouth? ever heard of AIDS? etc.. Any "yes"
response ends interview early when she slams the sliding window shut.  Since
this isn't an emergency, she sets up an appointment for nine months from now,
then slams the sliding window shut.  Hand on telephone takes us to the
"TouchTone Dialer" dialog again, where he can only dial the number on Doc's
business card (any other number responds, "that is not a working number"). He
convinces the receptionist he's "Dr. Payne, and I'm going to send one of my
emergency clients over for Doc Pulliam.  His name is Larry; Larry Laffer!"  

Alternative solution:  Larry takes the doily from the waiting room magazine
table.  Doily on self wraps it around his head in classic 3 Stooges-toothache
style.  He then walks to the window, knocks, receptionist opens window, see
doily, says "Oh, you poor dear!" and ushers him right in to...  

[after ChiChi]  Larry may use the telephone to dial the limo company.  Once
Larry's met ChiChi, no one ever answers the window.  

920   Chi Chi Lambada's Cubicle

Small low-tech dental cubicle.  Budget plan.  Dirty instruments.  Larry sits
in the chair waiting for Chi Chi Lambada's entrance.  No way for him to
leave.  She enters with great moves.  She is beautiful, fiery, Latin,
labada-dancing, petite gymnast, sexy, lithe, young chili pepper of a dental
hygienist.  She:  "Well?  Shall we get started?"  Larry:  "I'd rather have a
baby"  She:  "Make up your mind; I've got to adjust the chair."  She "tastes
great."  He wants "less filling."  He sits, chair reclines, she leans over. 
The chair angles must be just right to show her lambada-ing Larry's arm and
leg.  After a little snappy repartee and many pain jokes, we cut to...

930   Chi Chi Lambada Close-up

Extreme close-up of her face, with ceiling for background.  Great eyes, lips. 
She talks a lot; Larry can only mumble thru the instruments in his mouth. The
more she talks, the more she rubs, the less Larry needs to say.  She
discusses her gymnastics background as Larry dreams of yet-untried positions. 
"Have you ever considered dental floss an aphrodisiac?"  "Does the phrase
'Bucky Beaver' mean anything to you?"  Eventually she gets so excited, she
insists they adjourn downstairs to the gymnastics studio.  

940   Chi Chi & Larry's Gymnastic "Routine"

Picture is from outside the building, looking in through the window (and some
venetian blinds).  This is a cartoon showing ChiChi & Larry attempting
unsuccessfully to get together.  

The blinds open, we see ChiChi hanging by her heels from the rings.  Larry
swings towards her from offcamera upper-right releases a little too late,
missing her completely, flying across the room into the far wall, where he
does the classic toon "slide-down-the-wall."  The blinds close, pause, then
re-open.  ChiChi lies on the even parallel bars on her back, Larry runs
across the room towards the camera, uses the springboard to mount, and flies
over the apparatus into the exterior wall in front of us.  The blinds close,
pause, then re-open.  We see ChiChi walk from left to right on the balance
beam.  She does a slow roll to a handstand splits, then invites Larry to try
again.  Larry mounts the beam's left end gracefully, carefully walks to
ChiChi.  As he gets close, he loses his footing, and does the splits onto the
wooden beam.  He does a slow take to the camera as his legs tighten around
the beam, then he slowly rotates completely around the beam until he's hanging
upside down, still staring at the camera.  The blinds close, we iris in to
black, and next see Larry standing outside the gymnastics studio with the
line, "You vow to get in shape!"

                    Background Scene, View, and Loop Numbers

Naming convention:  Pictures (pix, pic) are referred to as p120, p130, etc. 
Views use "V", loops use "L", cells use "C", and rooms use "R".  Thus
V0/L2/C7 refers to the eighth cell of a southbound Larry.

Numbering convention:  Any view used as part of a background picture has the
same number as that picture.  Any specialized ego (either Larry or Patti)
used only in that one picture has the same number +1.  Any additional views
for that picture begin with +2 and continue up.  Ego views used in multiple
areas are numbered in the upper 500s.  Inventory views are in the upper 900s.

Graphic description convention:  Indentation, font size, and style denote
whether a line refers to a pic, view, loop, or cell as shown in this example:

###	This is a pic description
	###	This is a view description
		#	This is a loop description
			#	This is a cell description
