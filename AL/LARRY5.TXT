line 636:  Choose the Hand icon from the icon bar and
click its index finger where you would like to do some
"Action."

line 642:  This would be a good time to select the Eyeball "Look"
icon from the icon bar and click it on the coffee pot in
the upperleft corner of this room.

line 648:  Select the Hand "Action" icon and click it on the
coffee pot to use the coffee.

line 650:  If you haven't already,
now would be a good time to read the
documentation that came with this game.

line 679:  the coffee maker

line 686:  The coffee maker has just finished brewing a
fresh batch of Kahuii Koala Mocha-Homo Blend.

line 689:  There's no pot here. Remember? You broke it!

line 709:  Silas Scruemall's office door

line 724:  the "America's Sexiest Home Videos" sign

line 725:  Evidently this company is the home of
"America's Sexiest Home Videos."
You've heard of that show!
Especially since you work here!

line 734:  Yes, of course you think the sign is lovely,
but you really have no use for a big, ugly sign.

line 739:  If that thing talks back, you vow to leave the
building immediately!

line 759:  the portrait of Silas Scruemall

line 760:  "Our founder, Silas Scruemall!"

line 766:  Thinking yourself incredibly smart,
you attempt to remove the painting from the wall in order
to crack the safe which you feel certain lies behind it.

line 769:  You fail.

line 770:  (But not because you can't crack a good one!)

line 774:  Try talking to people instead.

line 791:  the poster

line 792:  Art is one thing, but this is something else!

line 798:  Take your hand off her!

line 799:  (You're smudging that fine cardboard surface!)

line 803:  You really ARE lonely, aren't you, Larry?

line 822:  the photographs

line 823:  The pictures are of past stars of PornProdCorp's many
films, television shows and artsy documentaries.
There are a total of zero pictures of
Chief Video Tape Rewinders like you.
You have no reason to assume you'll be the first!

line 833:  You really enjoy playing with your hands, eh, Larry?

line 853:  the hydrant photograph

line 854:  It's either the star of "Manhunter," or a fire hydrant,
you're not sure which.

line 861:  You have so much fun feeling things!

line 865:  You attempt to throw your voice into the picture.
You fail.

line 885:  the certificate

line 891:  "Class B Establishment" granted by the Board of Health.
(Contested by the Board of Good Taste!)

line 897:  This is in keeping with your opinion of this place.

line 917:  the plant

line 918:  You really enjoy the look of fine plastic.

line 924:  Ouch! Those plastic leaves are sharp!

line 928:  Does talking to plastic plants help them grow?

line 947:  the plant

line 948:  You really enjoy the look of fine plastic.

line 954:  Ouch! Pricked again!

line 958:  Does talking to plastic plants help them grow?

line 977:  the plant

line 978:  How you love plastic plants! (Especially the smell!)

line 984:  "SPROING!" says the leaf.

line 988:  Does talking to plastic plants help them grow?

line 1007:  the "Titty" award

line 1013:  "Presented to PornProdCorp for their humanitarian
efforts in the field of free speech and the commercial
development of the steel-reinforced videotape.
 
 
March 10, 1976"

line 1020:  Genuine Engraved Plastic

line 1023:  (Wow! It's a genuine "Titty!")

line 1027:  Is this the best thing you've found to do with your
hand cursor?

line 1046:  the chair

line 1047:  This chair and desk belong to the person least in favor
with your boss, Silas Scruemall.
Currently, they are unoccupied.
Often, you sit here.

line 1056:  You're afraid to sit down here since your boss may come
out of his office at any moment.
Shouldn't you continue with your mission?

line 1078:  the desk

line 1079:  This chair and desk belong to the person least in favor
with your boss, Silas Scruemall.
Currently, they are unoccupied.
Often, you sit here.

line 1088:  Rubbing your hand across the desk makes you appreciate
its fine vinyl woodgrain surface.

line 1107:  the cabinet

line 1108:  The only thing in the cabinet under the coffee pot is a
box of thoughtfully, premeasured, preweakened coffee
portions, and some empty plastic bags that used to hold
stacks of styrofoam coffee cups.
You have no need for either coffee or filters.

line 1118:  You have no need for coffee or filters.

line 1140:  the electrical outlet

line 1147:  The coffee pot is plugged into the upper electrical
outlet, and your battery charger is "currently"
occupying the lower outlet.

line 1151:  The coffee pot is plugged into the upper electrical
outlet, but the lower one is "currently" available.

line 1167:  Good idea! You can never tell when a guy might
need his pocket protector fully charged!

line 1172:  The camcorder can't be plugged into an outlet.
You must use its recharger base.

line 1195:  the hallway

line 1196:  This hallway leads to the Department of Video Tape
Rewinding and your workroom, where you fulfill your job as
Chief Rewinder and Sterilizer (Beta Division).

line 1210:  Teaching

line 1230:  You engage in a short, but personally meaningful
conversation with %s.

line 1236:  That feels exactly like %s.

line 1242:  It seems %s just doesn't work with %s.

line 1249:  Don't do that to %s!

line 49:  You are so proud of this, your humble workshop.

line 146:  Nope, nothing of interest in this drawer!

line 151:  This drawer only contains a few old donut crumbs.

line 157:  Without the battery recharger, this drawer
seems so empty!

line 162:  Well, well! What's this? So that's where
you left your battery recharger!

line 167:  You take it from the drawer and pop it into
your pocket.

line 230:  And you always thought those were DAT tapes!
You cleverly label the tapes "Girl 1," "Girl 2,"
and "Girl 3."

line 257:  The tape has already been degaussed.

line 267:  Sliding the switch to send rapidly alternating,
pulsating currents through your degausser, 
you sensually slide the girl's dedicated magnetic 
particles in slow concentric circles over the degausser,
gradually increasing in speed and intensity, 
until they (and you) are randomly aligned.
A shudder passes through your body!!

line 274:  By God, that's degaussing!

line 318:  the camcorder tapes

line 319:  You've found them! These are the tapes you need
for your new Pocket Protector Camcorder.

line 331:  You try in vain to insert your camcorder into
those tiny tapes.

line 371:  the lobby door

line 372:  The door to the lobby seems oh, so familiar to you.
Probably because you entered this room through it!
Your "The Girls of Videotape Technician's Magazine" 
calendar hangs on the back, open to Miss October, 
who (in your opinion) has the best "reels" of the
bunch!

line 414:  the degausser

line 415:  Your degausser, which you use to degauss tapes,
rests on the workbench.

line 422:  Degaussers work on tapes, not hands.
They return the magnetic particles to a random distribution.

line 424:  (They erase tapes!)

line 507:  It looks like a closed drawer.

line 530:  the cabinet

line 531:  You have no idea what's inside these cabinets since you
are too short to see inside.

line 538:  You've always wanted to look inside those
upper cabinets, but your arms are too short.

line 556:  your barrel of sterilizer

line 557:  This barrel contains the sterilizing solution that you use
on all incoming video tapes before rewinding them and
distributing them to the members of the ASHV Audition Team.

line 566:  You quickly rinse your hands with the sterilizing
solution. You rather enjoy it, although for the life
of you, you don't know why.

line 571:  "Hey, Sterilizer!" you yell into the metal drum.
"Every night's your night in the barrel!"

line 575:  You rinse %s in a stream of sterilizer,
effectively removing over 90%c of the bacteria from
its environmental surfaces.

line 598:  the video monitor

line 599:  You use this monitor every day to preview the incoming
submissions, making sure they're explicit enough to
pass on to the official members of the Submissions Team.

line 607:  You've seen enough of this monitor over the last few
months. You don't want to see any more.

line 612:  These tapes only fit in your Pocket Protector
Camcorder.

line 650:  the floor drain

line 651:  You often feel this is where your life is headed.

line 657:  Cleverly surmising the humble floor drain is really a
secret passage to another part of the building,
you yank and tug on the grate, 
only to find it is firmly screwed.

line 661:  (You can relate to that!)

line 664:  "Hello!" you shout down the drain.

line 665:  "Heeeellllooooo."

line 666:  "Heeeellllooooo."

line 667:  "Heeeellllooooo."

line 684:  the boxes

line 685:  You have no use for empty boxes.

line 691:  "Nah," you think, "who needs a box?"

line 708:  some videotapes

line 714:  These tapes are of no use to you.

line 717:  These are the tapes of the women who didn't make
the cut. They won't fit in your camcorder.

line 719:  (And neither do their tapes!)

line 826:  the lamp

line 827:  It's just hanging around here... rather like you, Larry!

line 860:  the fuzzy dice

line 861:  Your sole attempt to decorate your
workspace is one-half of a pair of
fuzzy dice, left over from your '74 Bug.

------

line 44:  PPC's file room is filled with file cabinets which
are filled with files.

line 114:  the credit card imprinter

line 128:  The empty credit card imprinter holds no 
fascination for you.

line 131:  Say! 
An exclusive "AeroDork Airlines Gold Card" 
rests in the credit card imprinter. 
Probably just someone racking up a few charges 
on the ol' company dole!

line 140:  The imprinter is of no value to you.
The Gold Card was all you needed.

line 162:  the drawer

line 170:  The "Winners" drawer is now empty.

line 173:  There are three resume files here.

line 176:  Why look! Here it is!! 
This drawer is labeled "Winners!"

line 184:  There was nothing else of value in that drawer.

line 240:  Assuming that your recent promotion now authorizes such
extravagance, you remove the luxurious "AeroDork Gold Card"
from the credit card imprinter.

line 322:  You take the three resumes from the drawer.

line 347:  Staring into the lamp
is an enlightening experience for you.

line 361:  the bookcase

line 362:  This bookcase is filled with everything but books.

line 368:  The bookcase contains nothing that is of use to you.
Perhaps you should look elsewhere.

line 386:  the nude painting

line 387:  You don't know much about art, 
but something about this painting touches your fancy!

line 394:  You'd love to fold this up for your wallet,
but you refuse to create a bulge in your leisure suit.

line 398:  "Were you ever featured in `National Geographic?'"
you wonder.

line 416:  your desk

line 417:  Why are there no workers in this place?

line 423:  What? You work?! No way!

line 440:  the lamp

line 441:  You admire anyone who uses incandescent lighting.

line 447:  You have no use for the lamp.

line 450:  "Testing 1, 2, 3!" you say forcefully, thinking that
desk lamp is a hidden microphone.

line 468:  the magnifier

line 474:  One of your favorite pastimes here at PornProdCorp is to
stand here holding the magnifier up to various parts of
your anatomy.

line 477:  Like your fingerprints, Larry!

line 478:  (Shame on you for thinking thoughts like that!)

line 481:  You move the magnifier slightly, 
then restore it to exactly the same spot again, 
all in the twinkling of a video scan!

line 502:  the file drawer

line 503:  This file drawer is labeled "Losers." 
You're looking for the files of the three finalists. 
This is no time to try to fatten your address book, Larry!

line 511:  As you start to open the drawer, you read the label, 
and decide this is not the drawer for you.

line 583:  some books

line 584:  Why would you want to look at books, Larry?
You can barely read!

line 598:  the fan

line 599:  This is your biggest fan!

line 605:  You are afraid to turn on that fan without 
protective garments.

line 607:  (And it, you!)

line 624:  your chair

line 625:  This chair is your favorite work-place sleeper.

THE Sexiest Woman in America! 
You're not going to find her sitting around in here!

You've always had a soft spot for twins.

She's PornProdCorp's founding mother: Chesty Turbo!

line 329:  You can't really do what you're thinking!

line 332:  "I'm so lonely," you moan to the statue.

line 335:  Larry! She's not that good!

line 352:  that PornProdCorp logo

line 353:  You presume PPC chose that logo because the tongue
is the universal symbol of good taste.

line 368:  the palm tree

line 375:  For just a moment, you have the feeling that tree is
the only thing in Hollywood that's straight!

line 378:  (Then you notice it's leaning!)

line 381:  You love the feel of palms, don't you, Larry?

line 384:  "I Talk to the Trees," you sing.

travel by limousine.

line 161:  Bobbi

line 245:  Bobby

line 940:  the video tapes

line 941:  There are many videotapes in that rack that you
would love to see. Unfortunately, the VCR is broken!

line 948:  You have no way to play those tapes since the
limo's videotape player is broken.

line 967:  the aquarium

line 968:  How bizarre! A limousine with an aquarium!

line 975:  You would love to grab the little fishy and pet him
and make him your friend and take him home and the two
of you grow old together and spend his final years resting
in a small bowl of briny water on your nightstand.

line 980:  As much as you would love to pet the fish,
the fish would prefer if you'd leave him alone.

line 1010:  the bottles and glasses

line 1011:  There are enough bottles of liquor and glasses

right front passenger's seat.
You wonder when it will be your turn to live high on

through the intercom,
"but my cellular telephone won't work in this area.
Too much interference or something."

phone!

line 1194:  xxx You already have the information you need,
Patti!

line 1204:  You don't need to use the phone right now.
But, perhaps later.

Soon a familiar voice answers.

line 1220:  "Hi ya, Boss!" you say cheerfully.
"I was wondering if I might get some
information from you."

If you want to make a telephone call,
your cellular phone rests right beside your right hand.

"I hope your journey was a pleasant one."

line 1722:  As you are ready to exit the limousine,
you notice a small leather binder on the seat beside you.
You feel certain the limo company will make no attempt to
locate its rightful owner, so you take it,
vowing to search relentlessly until you find its owner
and return his missing DayTrotter05 to him!

line 1738:  You think, "Who wants a stupid old DayTrotter05
anyway?" So you leave it and all the things that
came with it on the seat of your limo.
"Let somebody else hassle with that thing!" you think.
"I've got better things to do!"

line 1753:  Meanwhile... 
in a plane far, far away....

I'm glad to see you made it back safely.
I told you there was nothing to worry about!"

But for a while there, I was really stumped!"

line 156:  "Oh, you did fine!
Now let's go over what you discovered through
your investigations."

line 167:  "Let's begin with Baltimore and des Rever
Records.
What happened?"

line 183:  "It was easy.
I got past that guard in the Shill Building Lobby
just by showing him the DataMan05
into which I had inserted Reverse Biaz' cartridge."

line 192:  "It was easy.
I got past that guard in the Shill Building Lobby
just by showing him the Reverse Biaz fax."

line 200:  "It was easy.
I got past that guard in the Shill Building Lobby
just by finding Reverse Biaz' office in the building
directory."

line 209:  "I had real trouble there, Inspector.
I never could figure out any way to get past that
guard in the Shill Building Lobby."

line 225:  "Good work, Patti.
But what happened after you were upstairs?
Did you learn anything about des Rever or Biaz?"

line 233:  "Oh, no. That's too bad.
I thought Reverse Biaz was a major player.
He might have been the key to breaking this case."

line 249:  "While upstairs in des Rever's outer office,
I found a gold record which I think might contain some
valuable evidence.
Here, take it!"

line 258:  "I couldn't find anything interesting
in des Rever's outer office."

line 270:  "I discovered the gold record could
actually be played on a stereo system there.
It sounded fine."

line 282:  "But when I played the gold record
in reverse at 33-1/3, I heard a strange message.
It should be proof positive!"

line 299:  "Good going, Patti.
Did you make the recording session I booked for you?"

line 307:  "Actually, the studio session went pretty
well, Boss.
After a couple of tries, I started really cookin'!"

line 314:  "I'm sorry, but I just couldn't,
Inspector."

line 327:  "You'll loved this, Boss!
I just used an old technique with which I'm quite
familiar!
I grabbed some champagne from my limo and
got Reverse drunk!
So drunk, in fact, he gave me this cassette tape
to impress me."

line 340:  "Gosh, Boss.
I just used an old technique with which I'm quite
familiar!
Here's the tape I, uh, `talked' him out of!"

line 350:  "Here's the tape I, uh,
`talked' him out of!"

I wish you could have found something there."

he laughs.
"Our agents could have never `obtained'
evidence like you did."

line 386:  "So did you discover
anything at K-RAP radio?"

line 394:  "Well, I sneaked into John Krapper's
office just as the receptionist came back from her break."

line 400:  "Sorry, Boss, but I couldn't even
get past the K-RAP lobby!
They really had tight security!"

line 413:  "Good job, Patti.
Nice job of sleuthing!"

line 420:  "It's too bad you didn't get further
into the K-RAP building, Patti.
I think P. C. Hammer might well be crucial to this problem."

line 434:  "I searched John Krapper's desk and
discovered a folder filled with what looked like
incriminating evidence to me!"

line 442:  "I assumed he'd miss the folder if I stole it,
so I used his photocopier to make copies of it.
Here they are!"

line 451:  "Way to go, Patti. Nice work."

line 460:  "And, besides that,
I overheard what `2 Live 2 Screw' thought were private
conversations.
They didn't realize they were meeting in a room with
an open microphone!"

line 470:  "Although I nearly got trapped by P. C. Hammer,
I recorded `2 Live 2 Screw' on a reel-to-reel tape."

line 478:  "Great!
Patti, you have proven yourself the right woman for the
job!"

line 486:  "Good, Patti. May I have the tape?"

line 494:  "Uh, well, Inspector,
I must confess: I left it on the tape recorder
in the K-RAP control room.
I'm sorry."

line 507:  "Oh, that's all right, Patti.
Mistakes happen; even to super-spies!"

line 529:  "Patti, I don't know if this is an
appropriate time, but I must tell you:
I find myself strongly attracted to you."

line 536:  "Patti, you've done a wonderful job!
I'm so proud of you!"

line 545:  "You have such wonderful big, uh, er, eyes!
Even though you weren't much help as a spy,
I hoped you might feel something for me, too.
So, here's a little favor."

line 562:  "I have a small souvenir for you, Patti--a little
something for you to remember your experiences as
an F.B.I. agent."

line 572:  "I want you to have the exploding bra--and every time
you wear it, think of me!"

line 628:  Oh, Larry!
Here's another fine mess you've gotten yourself into!

line 639:  Whatever possessed you to volunteer to land a major
aircraft? This is far different from your futile attempt
a few years ago when you tried to sell flight simulator
software for a major computer games company!

line 657:  As the ground rushes headlong toward you,
you decide to make a run for it!
Maybe there are some parachutes tucked away under the
stewardesses' seats.
Maybe the other passengers won't notice you heading
for the exit with a parachute tucked under your leisure suit.
Maybe you'll be able to open the door.
Maybe you'll be able to fly!

line 672:  As you rise to leave,
you struggle against the severe G-forces pummelling your body,
inadvertantly catching the cuff of your leisure suit
on an inconspicuous switch labeled 
"Auto Pilot."

line 702:  Grasping at anything and everything on the dashboard,
you brilliantly (and totally accidentally)
hit something called an "Auto Pilot."

line 716:  The airplane's computer takes over,
stopping its spin, leveling out the plane,
and preventing certain disaster!

line 734:   YOU DID IT, LARRY!  

line 745:  But there's a slight problem...
now you've got to land this sucker!

line 764:  your plane

line 781:  yourself

line 803:  you

line 809:  You look like you're gonna die!

line 812:  You begin to talk to yourself then realize,
"I've gotta fly this sucker!"

line 816:  You scratch your ear instead of saving this plane!

line 819:  That won't help! Do something!

line 838:  the plane

line 844:  This is your plane, plummeting to Earth,
soon to crash, killing all aboard.

line 848:  "MAYDAY! MAYDAY!!" you scream,
into no apparent microphone!

line 852:  That won't help a falling airplane!

line 855:  How you wish it were that simple--to just reach
outside and grab your airplane,
pull it back to safety.
But you've learned long ago: you're not Superman!

And on a Saturday night, too."

you think. "Are there no good places left to play?"

line 218:  "Another grimy week on a grimy stage before 
another grimy scene in a grimy office with another 
grimy little night club owner!"

line 224:  (Just what did you expect from a club called 
"The Piano Pit," Patti?)

line 229:  Finishing your bows, you head for the manager's office.
"Now I suppose I'll have to endure another scene with 
another cheap club manager.
The perfect way to top off a perfect night," 
you think sarcastically.

owner, "that about wraps it up for me.
Looks like you've had another good week!"

line 273:  "Funny you'd mention that, Patti."

line 282:  "I was just getting ready to talk to you."

line 291:  "I hope you enjoyed the show, Andy,"
you say with a smile.

line 297:  "Oh, Patti, it ain't me.
You know I like you just fine.
It's just my boss that don't."

line 308:  "Julius doesn't much care for small audiences."

line 317:  "He says your fans listen too much and drink too little."

line 328:  "He can't see how he and his 'backers' can be
expected to make a profit like that."

I'll be sorry to see you go."

line 361:  "Well, then, give me my pay,
and I'll get out of here!"

line 364:  "Ah, er," he stutters,
"I guess that's the other thing:
I can't do that."

line 375:  "Julius says your contract was never valid,
so he doesn't have to pay."

line 385:  "WHAT!" you explode,
"Now you're saying I don't even get paid for the week
I have worked?!
I ought to file a grievance with the Musicians' Union!"

line 390:  Not exactly shaking, he replies,
"Do what you have to do, Patti, but if you ever want to work
anywhere in this town again..."

line 401:  His meaning is not lost on you.
"Goodbye, Andy! Somehow I expected more of you.
I don't know why!"

line 405:  "Patti, take my advice:
play more commercial.
Give 'em what they like!
A broad as good lookin' as you could really pull 'em in,
if you'd just get smart!"

You've handled rough situations before.
After all, think of all you went through back in

in a much nicer area of the city 
Patti meets Desmond at  
F.B.I Headquarters...

line 72:  You

line 100:  Desmond

line 131:  "Patti, I'm Inspector Desmond, of your
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
If it's alright, I'd like to request a few moments of your
time."

line 143:  "But, of course, Inspector," you reply.
"Nice trench coat!"

line 153:  "You too," he smiles, easily recognizing your joke.
"I'm here, on behalf of your country, to ask a favor of you."

line 163:  "Go ahead, Inspector, but I don't usually grant favors
on a first date! 
Besides, I'm not the private-eye type."

line 174:  He smiles again.
"Oh, you won't have to do that, Patti.
You see, you're exactly the `type' we need!"

line 185:  "Let me explain: we're right in the middle of a 
months-long, nation-wide investigation into the infiltration 
of organized crime into the entertainment industry."

line 196:  "I'm looking for a special someone,
someone willing to take some risks,
someone without a family, 
without many social ties,
without any extenuating circumstances to get in the way."

line 209:  "Someone who understands the music business,
who plays an instrument, 
and who has the looks, brains and talent to be accepted by
those insiders we're trying to catch."

line 221:  "I know you've been `stiffed' by these guys--probably
many times. 
I want these guys, and I bet you do too.
So, Patti, in short: I need you to go `undercover'!"

line 233:  "What do you say?"

line 242:  You are taken aback. 
But considering the requirements, 
who could be better for the job than you?
It would be sweet to get revenge on these guys, 
not just for tonight's embarrassment,
but for all those others times when you gave your talents
for a bunch of ingrates.

line 250:  "But, of course I'll help you, Inspector Desmond!"
you hear yourself say,
"after all, I recently learned I'll have the next week off."

line 261:  "So, how do we start?"

line 270:  "Follow me, Patti. 
I have a car and driver waiting for us."









420.SC 
------

line 58:  "Alright Patti, here's the deal:
we're convinced of organized crime's considerable influence
in the entertainment industry.
I want you to use your musical talent to help us obtain
sufficient evidence to convict the guilty parties."

line 72:  "But, Inspector," you say worriedly,
"I know nothing of spying."

line 83:  "Don't worry, Patti, most of the spies we use are amateurs!
You won't be `licensed to kill!'
Just keep your eyes and ears open,
learn what you can,
take advantage of any opportunities,
and try to bring back some hard evidence!"

line 98:  "We'll make sure you're in the right place at the right time.
And you'll be doing good for your country."

line 108:  You think, "Not to mention getting even with those
bastards for all the times I've been screwed in the past!"

line 114:  "Alright, Inspector Desmond," you say.
"But what places and what times?"

line 125:  "Two specific areas:
one is subliminal messages in popular music.
Our studies link the recent nationwide rise in crime to
increased popularity of hard rock music."

line 138:  "`des Rever Records' in Baltimore is heavily involved
in such subliminal recordings.
Much of the overdubbing at that studio is handled by a
young recording engineer named Reverse Biaz."

line 151:  "The second area is the recent flood of obscene
rap recordings.
I personally believe records like these are being used by the
Mob to undermine the moral fiber of our nation's youth."

line 164:  "`K-RAP Radio' in Philadelphia is the headquarters of
the rap group `2 Live 2 Screw,'
who have had an unjustified string of hits recently.
I'm sure that place is a center of Mob involvement."

line 176:  "That's hard to believe," you think.

line 181:  But to Desmond you say, "Well, all right, Inspector,
but I'm hardly an expert in subliminal recordings or
rap music!"

line 193:  "Oh, don't worry, Patti.
With your `talents,' you can easily fake your way through the
simplistic noise these guys pass off as music.
After all, they're hardly the M.J.Q.!"

line 206:  "One more thing: a man we know only as `Julius' has been
connected to both these businesses.
I think this `Julius' character may be the key
to the entire problem."

line 219:  "Anything you can discover about `Julius'
or KRAP or des Rever Records would be helpful.
We'll provide you with background information
on all the pertinent people, places and groups,
but it will be up to you to get in and
get out with whatever hard facts you can."

line 234:  "Okay, boss, I'm on! Now, how do I begin?"

line 244:  "Earlier this morning,
I set you up with a gig at des Rever Records as a keyboard
sub on a recording session."

line 256:  "We've also arranged a short East Coast tour as your
cover story.
The government will handle all your travel arrangements."

line 268:  "First class, of course?"

line 278:  "Yes," he laughs, "first class, of course!
I'll get you a private limousine and your own personal driver!
And, Patti, if things go well,
I'll even set you up with a gig at the White House!
Would you like that?"

line 292:  "Yes, of course!" you agree,
afraid now that you're in way over your head.

line 303:  "Come with me, Patti," Desmond says, rising to his feet,
"we'll get started right now!"

development lab to look like.

line 287:  "Welcome to our Technical Laboratory.
This is the head of our Office of Agent Field Equipment,
Commander Twit.
Commander Twit, meet Passionate Patti."

line 300:  "Good morning, Patti," says Commander Twit.
"It's so very nice to meet you."

line 311:  "Likewise, Commander," you reply, thinking that is
the first time you've ever said THAT phrase!
"What is all this wonderful equipment you have here?
I've always been very interested in research--and
researchers!"

line 322:  "You have?" Twit asks suspiciously.
"Well, allow me to show you about for a moment
before we begin your indoctrination."

line 334:  "Oh, I'd just love a tour," you say,
flashing your best smile.

line 342:  "Fine," Twit says, obviously charmed.
"Feel free to explore the lab a bit, Patti;
when you're ready, I'll get some information you'll need."

line 354:  "Enjoy your indoctrination, Patti,"
says Desmond, turning to leave,
"and especially your physical!"

line 396:  "Excuse me, Commander Twit," you say.
"I'm particularly interested in this man's research!
What is he up to?"

line 404:  "I suspected you might be intrigued.
Dr. Rolfing is working on refining our new
`infrared, heat-seeking, surface-to-air vibrator.'
We feel it will be of considerable value as a
protective device against certain types of enemy agents."

line 479:  "Of course, it works much better when you remember
to turn it on and then RELEASE it!"

line 499:  "Oh, Commander Twit," you say.
"What are these two men doing?"

line 505:  "Ah, now this is an experiment that I think should be of
great interest to you, Patti.
These two technicians are working on one of our latest 
Title 9-funded developments: the hair-trigger,
double-barreled, armor-piercing brassiere cannon."

line 549:  "How interesting, Commander!" you say.
"But how could you fire such a device?"

line 560:  "Heh, heh, that's the beauty of this baby," he exclaims,
his voice rising with pride.
"Just touch your elbows together behind your back!"

line 588:  The technician mistakenly believes Commander Twit is
speaking to him!

line 639:  "You idiot!" Twit shouts at the bra-slinging technician,
"I was talking to Patti!"

line 668:  "Obviously, our turnover rate is rather high here!"

line 700:  Commander Twit

line 701:  He's the perfect image of a man more interested in
science than in his own self-image!

line 720:  There's nothing you can do to Commander Twit that
he hasn't done already.

line 735:  "Whenever you're through exploring this area,
we'll set you up with the mission-required
information you're going to need."

line 416:  "Assume the position!" he barks.

line 426:  "Oops. Sorry. I used to be a field agent!
Old habits, you know."

line 443:  You enter his office,
slip behind a screen and remove your clothes,
replacing them with one of those wonderful hospital
gowns that leave nothing to the imagination.

line 447:  Oh, well. Things could be worse.
At least the good doctor is also a good looker!

line 462:  "Ah, yes, Patti.
I see you're interested in one of my pet projects,
which I find fascinating.
This man has developed a high-yield, space-age polymer,
macrobiotic, flatulence-inducing powder."

line 477:  "We feel it will be excellent for those times we find it
necessary to destabilize a public leader by humiliating
him during a major public appearance or state function!"

line 655:  "Well, well. That seems to be progressing nicely!
However, a lighter dosage may well be preferable!"

line 685:  Commander Twit

science than in his own self-image!

line 706:  There's nothing you can do to Commander Twit that
he hasn't done already.

line 717:  "Whenever you're through exploring this area, Patti,
please feel free to enter Dr. von Pelt's office."

F.B.I. gynecologist.

line 769:  If only you had paid attention when Larry chattered
on and on about his computer.
You know nothing about this computer and

After what you just went through,
you're in no hurry to go back in there!

Just look at all the dignitaries here to hear you perform.

line 220:  You are seated at the table closest to the door,
near the piano you are to perform upon after dinner.
Inspector Desmond sits across from you,
chatting with the women beside him.

line 232:  You carry on a meaningless dialogue with the two men
beside you.
What a shame the President was too busy to be here, though.
You feel sure he would have loved to meet you!

line 249:  A voice rings out from just outside the doorway,
"Ladies and Gentlemen, our Guest of Honor this evening,
fresh from his heroic rescue of an airplane filled with
U. S. citizens, including our Vice President's Mommy,
Mr. Larry, Larry Laffer!"

line 256:  "What!" you think. "Larry? MY Larry Laffer?"

line 274:  "Larry!" you shout. "It's you!!"

line 277:  "Patti!" Larry shouts. "It's you!!"

line 278:  Larry

line 342:  "Oh, Larry! I've missed you so!!"
You whisper in his ear.

line 356:  "What happened to you, Patti?" Larry sighs.
"The last I remember,
we were together on a deck overlooking a lake!
Where did you go?
Hell, where did I go?!"

line 361:  Larry

line 374:  "Oh, you sweet dear.
You really don't remember a thing, do you?
It's a long story that perhaps I'll tell you some day,
but right now,
all that matters is that we're together again!"

line 391:  "Uh, say Patti," Larry says,
"Since I had a little trouble finding a date for tonight,
why don't you join me on the dais?
We can talk about old times."

line 395:  Larry

line 408:  "Why, Larry! That would be wonderful."

line 462:  "Come on, Inspector Desmond," you say,
"we're gonna sit at the head table!"

line 480:  "Uh, Patti, er, well, I meant..."
Larry stutters, then finally gives up.
"Hi, Inspector. My name is Larry; Larry Laffer."

line 483:  Larry

line 486:  "Charmed," grunts Desmond.

line 607:  "Uh, excuse me, Patti.
Would you two scoot over a little
so your guest of honor can sit down, too?"

line 611:  Larry

line 679:  From nowhere, a Secret Service man appears
with a folding chair.

line 734:  "You know, Mr. Vice President," Larry says,
"you've always been a secret hero of mine!
In fact, the Vice Presidency is one office
to which I have always aspired to!"

line 739:  Larry

line 744:  "Mr. Laffer," responds the Vice President,
"has anyone ever mentioned to you that we look alike?"

line 746:  "Oh, of course. And am I proud!"

line 747:  Larry

line 779:  Before you can talk to Larry or Desmond,
you realize the large burly gentleman to your left is
already speaking to you.

line 810:  "...and it's fortunate that you're here this evening
as I'm only in town for a short time.
Yes, I'm testifying tomorrow on Capitol Hill at the Senate
hearings on pornography in the entertainment industry."

line 819:  "Oh, really?" you say, feigning interest.

line 825:  "You've heard of me, then?" he swells up noticably.

line 830:  "Yes, my job is simple:
tomorrow I intend to convince Congress to create tough,
anti-pornography legislation tough enough to make
the airwaves "Beaver" clean again,
just like they were back in the Fifties!"

line 843:  You love these dinners and being seated next to people
who feel their sole mission is to impress you with
themselves!

line 848:  (Especially a man who's breath is enough to curdle
hairspray!)

line 853:  "Allow me to introduce myself," he says,
"I'm Mr. Bigg, a major West Coast corporate leader."

line 861:  "My name is Passionate Patti," you reply.

line 867:  "And I bet I can guess how you earned that name,"
he grins.

line 878:  What an obnoxious creep!
Now he's humming at you.
Some familiar song.
A love song?
Who does he think he's impressing?

line 885:  "What is that song," you think.
"It sounds so familiar."

line 892:  Realizing you are still unimpressed, Bigg digs in deeper.

line 895:  "You know, Patti (may I call you Patti?),
I find you a very sexy woman.
In fact, I've been looking for just such a
woman for a new position I recently created."

line 904:  Between phrases, he continues to hum that melody.

line 910:  "Patti, you seem like a woman interested in quick
success.
Why don't you be the hostess of my new TV show?"

line 917:  "For months I've had minions out hunting for the
sexiest woman in America.
But tonight, I've discovered her myself!
Just say the word, Babe, and the gig is yours!"

line 926:  At the mention of "sexiest woman in America,"
Larry's head jerks toward Bigg,
his attention riveted on the conversation.

line 934:  "Really, Mr. Bigg, your offer is not interest..."

line 940:  Bigg interrupts you.
"Oh, Patti! Stop being so formal.
Please. Call me `Julius.'"

line 952:  "JULIUS!" you think, your mind racing!

line 993:  "Patti, something's wrong," says Larry.
"He's offering you the job as hostess of
`America's Sexiest Home Videos!'
But he has nothing to do with that show!
I should know, I do!
I was sent by the producer to find...
Say, wait a minute.
He could be the money behind the show...?"

line 1001:  Larry

line 1004:  "JULIUS!" you cry,
suddenly putting everything together!
"Desmond! Arrest this man!!"

line 1008:  "WHAT?!" shouts Bigg.

line 1009:  "You scoundrel!
You've been humming the love theme that I wrote for the
soundtrack of `Larry 4!'
That song was never published and the recording was
never released!
There's no way you could know it unless you
played Larry 4!"

line 1018:  Of course, I see it all now.
Bigg, you're the man who hired me to create the music,
then erased the floppies to keep from paying me!
You're the reason my poor Larry has amnesia!
You're the man behind K-RAP and des Rever Records!
Julius Bigg--you're the man I've been following this
entire game!"

line 1027:  "You're so smart, Patti!" screams Bigg,
"let's see you deduce your way out of this!"

line 1029:  And leaping to his feet,
he pulls a revolver and aims it directly at you!

line 1042:  "Everybody stay away or I'll shoot!" shouts Bigg.

line 1043:  Larry cries out, "I'll save you, Sir!"

line 1044:  Larry

line 1086:  Do something, Patti!

line 1103:  "It's a good thing I wore that F.B.I. bra!"
you think, touching your elbows behind your back.

line 1182:  "Congratulations, Patti!" says Desmond.
"You've saved the Vice President's life!
We'll haul this guy down to headquarters right now!"

line 1186:  Under his breath, Desmond whispers to you as he
passes, "Well, there goes our weekend!
Looks like I'll be stuck at the office filing paperwork
for days!"

line 1246:  "I'm sorry I shoved your face in that custard pie,
Mr. Vice President!" Larry says.

line 1248:  Larry

line 1267:  You turn to Larry,
"So... it looks like I'm free for the weekend.
How about you?"

line 1300:  Assuming you are talking to him, the Vice President
whispers carefully, so as not to let his wife overhear,
"Er, uh, well, yes.
Perhaps I could set up a little excursion to Camp David..."

line 1320:  Larry presumes the VeePee is being magnanimous.
"Gee, thanks!" he says in a loud voice,
"and I hope you and the missus get a chance
to come along too.

Why those are just some miniature video tapes 
I recorded while on the road."

line 107:  "Hey, fun! 
That'll give us something to watch at Camp David!"

Oh, never mind," Larry says.

Patti, I propose a toast to us--and

line 191:  Well, well!

line 195:  It seems all your "work" videotaping those girls
was for naught.
Silas Scruemall, producer of "America's Sexiest Home Videos," 
decided to "simplify the audition process" by magnanimously
awarding the show's hostess gig to his current girlfriend.

line 201:  "America's Sexiest Home Videos" went on to become 
the megahit of the season, proving clearly that P. T. Barnum
was right.

"clean up the airwaves."

line 215:  After a lengthy trial that increased tabloid sales
nationwide, Julius Bigg was found innocent of all charges
related to his incident at the White House dinner.

line 219:  In what was quickly dubbed the "custard pie" defense,
he pleaded "temporary insanity due to the high 
sugar content of those White House desserts" 
and got off with a mild reprimand from the judge
and six months of mandatory Jenny Craig meetings.

line 227:  Reverse Biaz soon found himself out of a job when
des Rever Records went bankrupt.

line 230:  Executives realized there's no longer any reason to add 
subliminal messages to recordings since kids can't figure out
how to play their CDs backwards.

line 236:  K-RAP became a national sensation when they expanded
by buying a small television station outside of Atlanta

line 240:  They promoted P. C. Hammer to his new position as
the nation's first "Nude VeeJay."
Their new slogan: "K-TV -- More Rap, Less Wrap!"

line 246:  The Mob's pornography business continued its
steady decline.

line 626:  "I'd really like to get something to eat,"
you say to the maitre d'.
"May I have a table now?"

line 631:  "I'd really like to get something to
drink," you say to the maitre d'.
"May I please have a table now?"

line 636:  "You know, it's amazing that a place like
this could even stay in business," you say,
beginning to lose your temper.
"I've never been to a place where the customer
is always WRONG!"

line 643:  "Let me into that cafe, you ninny,"
you shout at the maitre d'.
"You better let me in, I think!"

line 648:  "So when can I get in, eh?" you whine,
"I've got to meet somebody here!"

line 652:  "She's really quite lovely," you offer,
"in fact, I bet you know her."

line 656:  "Say, since I'm just going to stand here
anyway, why don't I tell you a little story?
A story about how a unassuming, traveling
software salesman, born near a log cabin in
Gumbo, Missouri, made it into the big time..."

line 663:  "Want to hear a little more about me?"
you offer.

line 670:  "Thanks for making that tape for me.
Could you give it to me now?"

line 675:  "Uhh, I seemed to have misplaced my membership
tape," you tell the maitre d'.
"Could you cut me a new one?"

line 681:  "Excuse me," you say to the maitre d',
"How do I get into that inner door?"

line 686:  "Thanks for the membership tape!" you say to
the maitre d'.
"But where do I go?"

line 699:  "No."

line 702:  "No."

line 705:  "No."

line 708:  "No."

line 711:  "No?"

line 714:  "Know."

line 717:  "Ho."

line 720:  "Who?"

line 723:  "OK! STOP!! I'll get you a damned ticket!"
he shouts.

line 732:  "I'm sorry, sir, but my limit is
one bore per customer!"

line 739:  "You fool! Eeet's hanging there in plain sight!"

line 744:  "I suggest you find transportation to another
location, Mr. (heh, heh) Laffer!" he smirks.

line 753:  "Just find a place to sit down.
You have an assigned table. Find it!"

line 769:  (Nice going, Larry!)

line 830:  "There you are, Sir!" barks the maitre d'.
"Enjoy your visit here at the lovely Hard Disk Cafe!"

line 863:  "I'm sorry, sir," he replies,
"but admittance to the exclusive `Herman Hollerith Room'
is limited to only our very finest customers."

line 871:  "(...which you are not!)"
he concludes under his breath.

line 910:  You grab your tape from the tape reader.

line 932:  the telephone

line 943:  A telephone rests near the maitre d's podium--and
it's finally available for your use!

line 946:  That woman has tied up the telephone for as long
as you've been here.

line 956:  There's no need to use the telephone again,
since you've already contacted the limo company.
Shouldn't you walk outside?
Your limo may be waiting for you.

line 965:  "Get off that phone," you shout.
"There are others here that want to make a call."

line 967:  She ignores you completely.

line 989:  the computer terminal

line 1002:  Bertha

line 1005:  A large aggressive woman has been talking on the
telephone for as long as you've been here.

line 1011:  "Get off that phone," you shout.
"There are others here that want to make a call."

line 1013:  Bertha ignores you completely.

line 1016:  "Hey, I'd like to make a call someday, myself,"
you say to the large woman.

line 1018:  Bertha ignores you completely.

line 1033:  Bertha's head

line 1049:  the music box

line 1062:  Music boxes show an early use of the principle that
made punchcard possible. It gave precisely aligned pins
meaning as musical pitches.

line 1066:  (How interesting: the music box's cylinder
appears to be the same width as your membership tape.)

line 1069:  Its cylinder is exactly 35 millimeters wide.

line 1075:  The music box is either very old and very tired,
or some practical joker has altered the pin placement
on its cylinder. It sounds terrible!

line 1082:  It's a music box, not an Edison cylinder recorder.

line 1091:  You wonder if this will ruin your only means
of admission to the Cafe!

line 1095:  If you punch any more holes in that piece of
tape there will be nothing left!

line 1128:  your membership tape

line 1132:  The membership tape you wanted so badly now hangs
limply from the side of the paper tape reader,
twisting slowly in the wind.

line 1173:  the maitre d'

line 1174:  You are quite envious of those that can look
stupid and snooty at the same time.

line 1182:  (You wonder if his French accent could
be fake?)

line 1190:  "Hello," you say to the maitre d',
"do you have a table for a guy like me?"

line 1194:  "Just use the membership tape I created for you," he replies.

line 1196:  "Please keep your hands off me," says the
maitre d'. "I'm for the use of members only!"

line 1208:  "Why don't you get your tape out of
the machine?"

line 1221:  "You know, I'd really love to be rid of
all these troublesome credit cards,"
you tell the maitre d'.
"Would you be willing to trade them for a table
inside?"

line 1226:  "But, of course, Sir!" he replies,
snapping to attention.
"I always have a soft spot for a fine
fellow like you!"

line 1238:  "You might want to save these,
Sir," he replies. "You may need them later.

line 1245:  "Would you mind throwing this away for me,"
you say, "Now that I know how to get here
I don't need it any more."

line 1249:  "Wee, wee, moisture!" he replies.

line 1261:  "Would you like to see my appointment
calendar for the next year?" you ask the maitre d'.

line 1263:  "Hardly," he sniffs.

line 1288:  the swinging doors

line 1310:  the swinging doors

line 1319:  You presume this door leads to the cafe proper.

line 1335:  This door operates by means of a Membership
Tape inserted and read by that machine to the left.

line 1341:  Insert your tape into the machine just
to the left of this door.

line 1345:  You might try using that on the maitre d'.

line 1362:  the maitre d'

line 1418:  the paper tape machine

line 1427:  An ancient mainframe computer's paper tape reader
sits against the far wall near the door.

line 1430:  Your membership tape is still hanging from the side
of the machine.

line 1442:  This paper tape reader grants access to the
"Hard Disk Cafe" proper,
which is located behind those closed doors.
To enter, just insert your membership tape in the slot.

line 1476:  the antique disk drive

line 1478:  This early disk drive was the size of a washing
machine and held an enormous amount of data--over
one megabyte.

line 1485:  This disk drive is for display purposes only.

line 1503:  the Pet Computer

line 1504:  You haven't seen a Pet Computer since
the early days of "InfoWorld!"

line 1510:  This computer is for display purposes only.

line 1527:  the Apple II computer

line 1529:  You cut your first computer teeth on an old integer
BASIC Apple II. It wasn't even a Plus!

line 1535:  This computer is for display purposes only.

line 1552:  the cash register

line 1554:  This NCR baby was one of the first
microprocessor-controlled point-of-sale cash registers.

line 1560:  This computer is for display purposes only.

line 1578:  the green screen monitor

line 1579:  This ancient device could display text in any color
you wanted, as long as it was green on black.

line 1585:  This computer is for display purposes only.

line 1602:  the Atari 400 computer

line 1604:  Boy, does that Atari 400 bring back fond memories of
your misspent youth, playing "Frogger" when your
classmates were dating!

line 1611:  This computer is for display purposes only.

line 1628:  the antique tape drive

line 1629:  This is one of the world's first tape drives,
revolutionary in its day, it seems incredibly
quaint today. Why it couldn't even hold
"Space Quest" let alone a "King's Quest!"

line 1639:  This machine once used magnetic tape,
not paper tape.

line 1663:  the piano roll

line 1665:  The player piano was an early use of punched holes to
control a mechanical device.
A vacumn was applied to 88 holes in a metal bar,
with each hole indicating a different musical pitch.
Where holes occuried in the moving paper,
the corresponding notes were played.

line 1673:  The historic old piano roll is hermetically sealed
in that glass case.

line 1686:  the punch card machine

line 1688:  This punch card reader dates from the 1890 U. S. Census.
It could handle up to 80 characters or columns of data,
a number which remains to this day as the width of most
computer video display devices.

line 1694:  A sign on the punch card reader requests
that you keep your hands off.

line 1708:  the chair

line 1710:  This chair is for the exclusive use of the maitre d'.

line 1723:  the bulletin board

line 1725:  The bulletin board is filled with photographs of
famous nerds who frequent this place!

line 1739:  the maitre d's podium

line 1742:  The maitre d's podium is just the right size for him
to hide behind when the crowds here start throwing
things!

line 1757:  the desk

line 1759:  You wish you had such a nice desk in your crummy
office.

line 1773:  the cactus

line 1776:  The cactus is covered with needle-sharp needles.
(Hence, the name "Needlenose Cacti.")

line 1782:  "OUCH!"

line 1785:  Who do you think you are, Snoopy's Uncle Spike?

line 1790:  Punch holes in your membership tape?
A good idea, but this is not the way to do it.

line 1814:  the cactus

line 167:  At last you are inside the "Hard Disk Cafe's" cafe.
But where in the world is YOUR seat?

line 170:  You could sit like these and watch people all day.
In fact, you may have to, as there seems to be an 
extreme shortage of waiters in this place.
No wonder there's no crowd!

line 247:  Look, Larry! 
There she is!!
It's your "target" for New York City:
Michelle Milken.

line 425:  the door

line 444:  You know it's possible to get in there, but
how will you? Michelle used that paper tape reader.

line 447:  You wonder what lies behind "The Magenta Door."

line 452:  This door operates by means of a Membership
Tape inserted and read by that machine to the left.

line 459:  "Hello. Is there anyone inside?"

line 464:  Insert your tape into the machine just
to the left of this door.

line 468:  You might try using that on the maitre d'.

line 489:  It's her, Larry! 
Watch her carefully; perhaps you could follow her!

line 491:  Michelle Milken

line 496:  "Yoo hoo, Michelle!" you cry, 
fumbling to find the words that would stop a knockout like
this one.
"Wait! I've just got to meet you!"

line 516:  the fat lady

line 517:  You presume she's the one who sings when it's over.

line 525:  "Getchur hans off'n my grub!" screams the
woman.

line 529:  "Excuse me, madam," you say, "do you 
have any idea how to enter the other room?"

line 531:  "Glub, glub, glub," is her only sound.

line 649:  You can't sit there.
You weren't assigned to that table.

A small sign on the table reads, 
"Track 45, Sector 4F."
This is your table, Larry!

line 686:  You no longer have to sit at this table, Larry.
You are now a "SuperUser!"

she responds.

line 166:  "That may be,
but I look even better out of it!"

line 173:  "Well, you may sit down,

line 315:  Why not talk to that beautiful woman instead.
Go on, Larry; strike up a conversation.

when none of the others do.

line 343:  "OUCH!"

line 361:  the table

line 362:  Here's another couple having a wonderful evening
while you wander around all alone again!

line 369:  You can't sit with a strange couple!

line 374:  "Excuse me, may I join you?"
you ask the couple at the left table.

line 378:  "No. I'm sorry, but we're eating."
replies the wit at the table.
"And I don't want to lose my appetite."

line 457:  "Hi, folks; I'm from out of town." you yell to
the diners at the table across the room.

line 482:  the table

line 483:  A breathtakingly beautiful black woman sits alone at a
booth, playing slowly and sensually with her dessert.
It's Michelle Milken. You've found her, Larry!

line 491:  You know what you want to do, Larry.
Your problem is figuring out how to do it!

line 495:  Perhaps you should sit down with her first.

line 498:  A little premature, aren't you, Larry?
Maybe first a little dinner,
then a show,
perhaps a little dancing....

line 506:  "Hello, Lovely Lonely Lady," you say to the
gorgeous babe sitting all alone in the booth near you.
"Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Larry; Larry Laffer."

line 512:  You hope she doesn't just ignore you.

line 513:  "Hi, Larry," she says with a friendly smile,
"new in town?"

line 518:  Remembering your boss' warning not to reveal
your identity, you decide to begin with a casual
opener, "Do you come here often?" you ask.

line 526:  Perhaps I could mention her "power clothes,"
you think to yourself.
A compliment on her apparel might be appropriate...

line 531:  "What a lovely suit you're wearing,"
you tell her. "And you certainly look good in it!

line 538:  "I notice you're dining alone," you try again.

line 541:  "Yes, and dining isn't the only thing I
don't enjoy doing alone!" she responds with a smile.

line 546:  "I was wondering: may I join you for dinner,"
you say.

line 573:  the serving cart

line 574:  It looks like this cart is the only table available.

line 580:  You can't move the cart. Then you'd have no table!

line 598:  the lamp

line 599:  It casts an even illumination.

line 792:  "Allow me to make our booth just a little more
private," says Michelle, standing up.

line 812:  the curtain

line 831:  Every booth has curtains to assure your total privacy
while dining.

line 835:  There's nothing you can do with the curtains.

line 841:  They don't want to talk to you, Larry!

line 844:  Just leave them alone!

line 847:  Don't you get the hint?
They don't want to talk to you!

line 867:  the curtain

line 875:  "DEAR!" interrupts his wife, "that's not necessary!
This is a family restaurant!"

line 896:  There's nothing you can do with the curtains.

the woman replies snootily.

line 87:  You are sitting with the gorgeous Michelle Milken
in an exclusive private booth
in the exclusive Herman Hollerith Room
in the exclusive Hard Disk Cafe
in exclusive New York City,
trying hard not to stare through
her see-through blouse.

line 167:  Perhaps you should take the initiative, Larry.
You've been sitting there for over a minute now.
Try something!

line 180:  "You know, Larry,
it's nice just sitting here with you,
but I'm going to have to run.
I've got a big, uh, er, `bored' meeting I'm late for.
Maybe I'll see you around, eh?"

line 193:  "Wait, Michelle!" you cry as she leaves,
"I've still got a few things left to say..."

line 200:  Well, Larry, you "blew" that one!

line 204:  Hanging your head in shame,
you wander back to the lobby.

line 333:  Oh, NOW you get her drift!

line 337:  You're almost sorry you're recording all this.
What will the boys in Hollywood think?

line 340:  What a shame you didn't get this on tape, Larry!

line 371:  You more than willingly give all your money to
Michelle!

line 376:  xxx You won't need those credit cards,
so you gladly offer them to Michelle,
in return ?to? more of the same!

line 382:  Leafing through your DayTrotter05 with Michelle,
she expresses an interest in some of those cryptic numbers
listed beside the notation "Swiss Accounts."
You allow her to keep the book,
since you have no interest in chocolate.

line 389:  After a few more minutes with Michelle,
you stagger to your feet and attempt to walk back
to the Hard Disk Cafe lobby.

line 459:  "Oh, Larry. Don't you just love stiff cream?"

line 513:  "Well, there goes her cherry," you think.

line 528:  "Oooooh, Larry!" says Michelle.
"I know a way we can `increase your interest!'"

line 538:  (What does she mean by that, Larry?)

line 542:  "You're a `software' kind of guy and
I'm a `hardware' kind of girl," she says.
"How about if I `download onto your hard disk?'"

line 553:  "I have an idea, Larry.
Why don't I make our booth a little more private."

line 570:  "Would you be interested in this?" you ask.
"It's `my' personal organizer and contains a list of all
`my' Swiss bank accounts, off-shore deposits, and
international funds."

line 574:  "Well, I don't know," she pretends to hesitate.

line 582:  "Why, yes," she says with a big smile,
"I'm sure I could `invest' these for you tomorrow!
Trust me!"

line 600:  "Would you be interested in this?" you ask.
"These credit cards would surely be useful to you
if you ever need to withdraw funds.
You know, cash advances, things like that?"

line 606:  "Oohh," she squeals,
"perhaps I haven't mentioned how much I enjoy
these things!"

line 624:  "I also have this little bit of cash on me,"
you say, offering it to her.
"Could you make some investments for me with this?"

line 629:  "Oh, could I?!" she cries.
"As my friend, Donald Tramp says, `cash is king!'"

line 649:  "Did I mention my name?" you ask.
"I didn't think so. My name is Larry; Larry Laffer."

line 651:  "Good evening, Lawrence," she says,
"I'm Michelle Milken, program-trading specialist and
sometime computer hobbyist."

line 661:  "I'm really into computers," you say,
exposing wisdom beyond your years.
"In fact, I've written a couple of very successful
computer games. At least, I think I have."

line 667:  "Oh, really," says Michelle.
"Does that mean you have lots of money?"

line 675:  "I make a nice living, er, well, that is,
I think I did!" you say. "But now I'm not so sure.
You see, I've been having a little trouble lately with amnesia.
So what is it that you do?"

line 681:  "I laugh all the way to and from the bank!"
she says with a grin. "I'm a junk bond dealer."

line 690:  "So, what does a junk bond dealer do?" you ask.

line 693:  "Whatever she can," Michelle replies cryptically.

line 700:  "I've been hearing lots of good things recently
about junk bonds," you say.
"Would you recommend them as an integral part of my
portfolio?"

line 706:  "Junk bonds, eh?" she warms perceptibly.
"Why I was just telling a friend about them today.
Yes, I think they would be perfect for someone like you!"

line 715:  "Really? I always thought investments like that were
too risky for an ordinary guy like me!"

line 719:  "Larry, no one I know would ever admit to
thinking that you are in any way, shape, or form, `ordinary!'"

line 727:  "So,
do you have any cash-equivalent funds lying about,
just gathering whatever conservative interest rate you're
presently earning?"

line 737:  "Well, no, Michelle, I don't," you say.

line 744:  "Michelle, I just thought of something!" you say.
"I might just have lots of royalties waiting for me
from my last job.
Of course, I can't quite remember if I do or not,
but it is something to consider."

line 751:  "And consider it I do, Larry," Michelle replies.
"In fact, perhaps I could open your account right now."

line 760:  "Huh? Well, oh, I don't... Ohhh!"
you say as a big smile crosses your lips.
"Well, okay, Michelle, have it your way!"

line 783:  Michelle Milken

line 791:  You can see why this woman made the finals back at
good ol' PornProdCorp!
She has to be one of the sexiest babes YOU'VE ever seen!

line 794:  (But she sure has a funny way of eating ice cream!)

line 797:  While you may wish to reach across the table and just
grab her, your professionalism to your mission and your
employer prevent such blatant, crass behavior.

line 802:  "Hmmm," says Michelle, with a coy smile,
"that's an idea!"

line 823:  Yeah, that ought to impress her, Larry.
Give her a napkin that she could pick up off any
table in the building!

line 828:  "Oh, no thanks, Larry," responds Michelle.
"I have no idea what I'd do with that."

line 851:  her eyes

line 852:  Her sultry eyes burn into your soul.

line 868:  her mouth

line 869:  Her lips are moist and inviting.

where THAT ice cream is!

don't you, Larry?"

line 937:  "There's plenty of time for that later, Larry!"

Well, now you've heard it,
so this time really let me have your best shot!"

line 474:  "That's a little TOO sparse,
Patti-cakes, babydoll.
Let's take it at the upper-left corner, okay?
And this time, how about a little more intensity,
okay, kid?"

line 483:  "Well, that was fairly outside!
Let's give it one more shot, babe. Here we go!"

line 502:  A Tip from Al Lowe

line 558:  "Take %d!"

line 823:  "Why don't you come into the control room now
and listen to the playback with me?"

line 830:  "Great take, Patti!
Why don't you come into the control room now
and listen to the playback with me?"

line 903:  "Here you go, babe. Check this out!"

line 973:  "Nice playing, Patti," he smiles,
"I bet you have wonderful technique!"

line 988:  "Well, Patti," Reverse says,
"I've got another session starting soon.
You're going to have to go now; I've got to get to work!"

line 998:  After failing in your attempt to get evidence from
Reverse Biaz, you return to your limo.

line 1043:  "What would you say if I proposed a toast,
Mr. Biaz?"

line 1049:  "Why, Patti!" he replies with a grin,
"I'm always interested in sharing a glass of champagne
with a beautiful woman!"

line 1060:  "To you, Patti!" he proposes a toast.
"And to many more successful sessions together!"

line 1112:  Ahh! A pleasant vintage," he sighs,
"but it's a little warm, isn't it?"

line 1122:  "Well, possibly so," you say in its defense,
"but then, you don't know where it's been!"

line 1127:  "Here, Mr. Biaz," you say, "have a little more."

line 1151:  "One more won't hurt, Mr. Biaz," you say,
using a technique on him that's worked more than
a few times on you.

line 1156:  "No, but I'd love to hear!"

line 1159:  "I've shown you my work;
will you show me yours?"

line 1163:  "Oh, really? How could that be, Reverse?"

line 1191:  "Please, call me Reverse!"
slurs Reverse, "So, Patticakes,
have I ever told you what an important guy I am?"

line 1199:  "Sshaay, thissh issh tasshty!"

line 1205:  "Why, ssshweetie, my ssshtuff's on
more recordsssh than anybody'ssh!"

line 1212:  "Eassshy, ssshugar!" slurs Reverse.
"Lemme find you a sshample!"

line 1250:  "Wait'll ya hear thissh," slobbers Reverse.
"Every ssshong hasssh ssshomething ssshublimal!"

line 1260:  Good job, Patti!
The boys back at the F.B.I. Labs will have a wonderful time
extracting those backwards subliminal messages from
Biaz' tape!

line 1281:  "So, Mr. Biaz, I understand you're quite a
successful recording engineer," you say.

line 1285:  "I just love studio work," you say with a
knowing smile.

line 1289:  "Why, thank you, Mr. Biaz," you say,
fluttering your lashes,
"I think I was especially inspired today--by you!"

line 1294:  "Oh, that would be wonderful, Mr. Biaz."

line 1297:  "And please, call me Patti!" you say,
ignoring the fact that he has been calling you Patti.

line 1301:  "I'll only be in town a short time, Reverse,"
you say, your voice filled with warmth.
"I'd certainly like to have a little something to
remember you."

line 1309:  "Is there a chance I could get some samples
of your work," you say with a knowing glance.
"In fact, I'd love to `add your work' to my
collection."

line 1320:  "Yeah, I can't complain," he replies.
"I have several `clients' who keep me quite busy."

line 1327:  "Oh?" answers Reverse.
"Well, you did do a nice job on this cut."

line 1334:  Warming noticeably, he continues,
"Well, Patti, I do know a lot of very important people
in the recording business.
I suppose I could drop your name in a few right places."

line 1343:  "Please... call me Reverse!"

line 1352:  "Why, I think that could be arranged,"
he says.
"What is it you're thinking of?"

line 1360:  "I'd be glad to give you some samples
of my work, Patti," he says with a wink,
"if I can have a sample of YOURS!"

line 1387:  More than willing to "serve your country"
(especially with such a hunk),
you throw yourself enthusiastically into your mission.

line 1563:  Eventually, through one sacrifice after another,
you eventually obtain a small cassette tape from Reverse Biaz
containing some of his best work.
It is exactly the evidence you've been seeking.
The boys back at the F.B.I. lab will have a heyday
playing with this one.

line 1595:  the door

line 1596:  This door leads to the control booth--and Reverse Biaz.

line 1603:  You would like to see the control room,
and talk with Mr. Biaz,
but first you want to complete this recording session.

line 1621:  Reverse Biaz

line 1622:  Reverse Biaz is the man the F.B.I. linked to
backwards subliminal message recording at this studio.
But he does looks cute.

line 1633:  "Oooh! Now that feels nice, Patti."

line 1637:  You are unable to touch Reverse Biaz through
that double-paned soundproof glass.

line 1645:  "Patti, I can see your lips moving,
but I don't have an open mike out there.
Just go ahead and play, and we can talk later, okay?"

line 1659:  You don't pour THROUGH glass, Patti,
you pour INTO glass!

line 1666:  "I don't why you're offering me that, Patti.
Did you come to play or come to bargain?"

line 1678:  You have no way to do that through that window!

line 1712:  the control room mixer

line 1727:  the tape reel

line 1735:  You assumed all modern studios recorded directly to
hard disks!

line 1740:  Reverse would prefer you to leave his reels alone!

line 1742:  Those tapes are inaccessible to you--for now!

line 1759:  the tape reel

line 1776:  the tape reel

line 1793:  the tape reel

line 1809:  the VU meter

line 1810:  This meter measures dynamic levels in decibels,
each of which is about 1/10th of a bel.

line 1823:  the key

line 1864:  Wow! It's a Farelight 2000, the highest-tech high-tech
synthesizer keyboard.
You've always wanted one of these for its wonderful
Boesendorfer patch!

line 1868:  Gurn Blanston plays one with "Rex Famine and the
Limestone Buglegs."

line 1873:  You can't play the synthesizer keyboard from inside
the control room!

line 2088:  your synthesizer

line 2089:  This is the synthesizer Reverse Biaz wants you to play.

line 2109:  the music stands

line 2110:  You see a bunch of music stands.
Or is it a flock of music stands?
Or is it a bevey of music stands?
You always forget.

line 2126:  the control room

line 2127:  From his control room, Reverse can see the entire studio.
He can speak to you through the soundproof glass via
a talkback loudspeaker.
He can hear you through the microphones.

line 2143:  the overhead mike

line 2144:  You wonder how many evil recordings were done with
this microphone.

line 2159:  the drum set

line 2160:  As in most studios, the drum set is behind glass to
enhance the separation of his sound from the other
musicians.

line 2180:  the music

line 2187:  This is the song you recorded for Reverse.

line 2189:  This is the song you are supposed to perform.
You DO remember how to play keyboards, don't you, Patti?

line 2195:  You can't reach the music from inside the control
room.

line 2198:  There's no need for you to turn the page, Patti!

line 2217:  the synthesizer control panel

line 2218:  des Rever Records spared no expense programming this
synthesizer for this session.

line 2226:  You can't reach the synthesizer from inside the
booth!

line 2229:  As much as you hate to,
you just can't resist tweaking a patch here and there!

line 2249:  the control room mixer

line 2255:  The control room mixer is covered with a
complicated array of sliders, knobs, buttons,
patch bays and XLR connectors.

line 2260:  You'd love to get your hands on those potentiometers,
but assume Reverse is as particular as most engineers!

line 2279:  the studio control panel

line 2280:  This panel contains many digital reverb and
special effects units, power amplifiers, patch bays
and a copy of last month's Playboy.

line 75:  The Ballroom is pulsating with people -- all of them men.
"Where are the women?" you wonder.

line 428:  The public address system booms through the hall,
"Come on, guys, let's give a great big welcome
to the last contestant in the big
`Tramp This! Wet T-Shirt Contest,'
Miss Jennifer Jiggle!"

line 496:  "And that completes today's matinee, guys!
Come back later today for the wonderful
"Tramp This! Mud Night Madness"
mud wrestling contest!"

Let's see what you've got!"

line 605:  "What'sa matter, Larry?
Are you a wimp or a mouse?"

line 611:  "What a woosie! Get up here!"

line 616:  "A REAL man would be up here already!"

line 621:  "What's wrong, Big Boy?
Afraid I might win?"

line 627:  "Geez, Larry! What a chicken!"

line 702:  Jennifer Jiggle

line 723:  "Hey, Jennifer! Why don't you really wet down that
T-shirt?" you shout.

line 727:  There's nothing you can use on Jennifer that she
hasn't used on herself already!

line 731:  You really wish she'd take off that shirt,
don't you Larry?

line 746:  Lana Luscious

line 747:  Lana looks much different, now that she's out of her
roller skates and into her element!

line 755:  You'll have to pay first, Larry!

line 758:  "Oh, yeah, Lana? I'm not afraid of you,"
you say quietly.

line 817:  the bouncer

line 818:  You feel certain this bouncer is not nearly as wise
as you in the ways of women.

line 827:  The gentleman blocking your path will be glad
to allow you to pass -- for a price.

line 830:  Since you've paid, he now treats you with all
due respect.

line 833:  (Evidently you have none due!)

line 837:  He'd bounce you a long way if you tried that!

of humor.

Up front.

friendly bouncer. "Would it be O.K. if I only
paid you $%d.00? I seem to be a little short!"

line 942:  The bouncer scowls at you.

line 944:  Yeah, and not just in that wimpy little fake
eelskin wallet, Donkeydoo. Get out of here!

line 951:  "Hello, Mister," you say to the bouncer.
"I'd like to purchase one of your better seats.
Here's my $25.00."

line 956:  Thanks for nuttin'. Ya get the best seat in
the house -- which presently is also the only
seat in the house!

line 964:  "Hello, Mister," you say to the bouncer.
"I'd like to participate in the evening's
next event. Here's my $500.00"

this? Why, your leisure suit might get dirty!

Lana becomes more and more passionate,
until the two of you,
oblivious to the hundreds of men staring at you,
roll off the ring onto the floor and begin shedding clothes!

line 271:  How embarrassing!

line 288:  "Oh Lana, I just don't understand!
I suppose it's because Bucephalus has never performed
in front of 900 people before!"

line 291:  You

line 300:  Now you're sorry you even started that camcorder.
What will the boys back in Hollywood think
of your less than stellar performance?

line 306:  You're so glad you didn't get this on videotape!
That's all you need--more humiliation back at the office!

line 324:  You slink out of the ballroom to the hisses and boos
of hundreds of men, each of which is thinking,
"Thank God that wasn't me!"

line 348:  Lana

line 349:  How Lana has changed!
Outside, she was just a beautiful young lady.
In here, she's an animal!

line 132:  The commercialization of the lovely Tramp Boardwalk
seems complete.
Businesses line every inch of the far side of the boardwalk.
At least the near side has been kept open for
fishermen and skaters.

line 284:  Be careful, Larry!
You nearly skated right off the boardwalk.

of the Boardwalk, a skater finds true happiness,
blading his little heart out!

your favorite collegiate hangout!

line 1064:  What a strange location for a
rocket fuel manufacturing plant.

line 1068:  You haven't seen a slot-car raceway in
years!

line 1072:  The "Salty Dog Saloon" is built upon the
very same location as the old "Pepper Dog Saloon,"
which burnt down years ago in the Great Tramp
Boardwalk Fire of '06.

line 1079:  Wow! In this place you can watch movies
for only 25 cents! What a bargain!

line 1083:  This is one of the last of the juke joints!

line 1086:  You wonder what they sell inside the
"Love Shack."

line 1090:  This house was built here many years ago,
before there even was a Tramp Boardwalk!

line 1094:  Recliners are a very popular item among
any Atlantic City tourists that can still walk!

line 1102:  A sign on the front door reads,
"Shirts? No shoes. No service."

line 1106:  Carlos Escobar has been running this taco
stand ever since he wrecked his van staring at
sidewalk scenery!

line 1111:  You wonder if they have your favorite
poster--the large-size, full-color,
"Bobby Vinton Perspiring!"

line 1116:  The owners of the "Live Girl" shop faring
much better financially since they changed the
name from the "Dead Girl" shop!

line 1125:  Contrary to popular rumor,
this is NOT a jukebox recycling center.

line 1129:  If you want a CD real bad, this is the place!
They've got some CDs that are real bad!

line 1133:  No boardwalk is complete without the
requisite salt-water taffy store.

line 1139:  Look! It's the skate shop of the
supermarket-famous Ivana Tramp!

line 1151:  Sorry, Larry.
A sign on the door clearly reads,
"No shirt, no shoes, no service".
You're going to have to remove your skates
before entering.

line 1161:  A small sign near the front door of the shop reads,
"Closed in Honor of The Donald's Birthday!"

"I've come a long way to meet you!"

line 1502:  "And meet me you have, Larry," says Lana.
"Whaddaya say we sit down on that bench over there.
These skates are killing me!"

line 1510:  "It would be my pleasure."

line 1915:  "Skate here often?" you ask.

line 1919:  "Only when I'm trying to find a man,"

line 1930:  "So, does that happen often?" you ask.

line 1934:  "Only when I'm here skating,"
she says with a smile.

technique," you tell Lana.

line 1951:  "If you like that, you should drop by the
`Tramp This! Mud Wrestling' Show.
I go on in just a few minutes!"
she says with a wink.

line 1964:  "Where is the mud wrestling held?"
you ask.

line 1970:  "Why, it's in the Tramp Ballroom.
The entrance is at the rear of the casino!"
she says.
"And if you bring a few hundred dollars with you, I'll
make sure it's an experience you'll never forget!"

line 1980:  (You now understand why Lana made the top three
finalist back at PornProdCorp!)

line 1992:  "I'll be there, Lana!" you exclaim.
"See you there!"

line 2055:  "Larry! Here?" says Lana.
"Why don't you come by the Casino later when I'm
mud wrestling?"

line 2062:  "Oh, I have no use for anything you could
possibly offer me, Larry," says Lana.
"Why, when I have total access to this sun-drenched boardwalk,
the fresh ocean breezes caressing my hair,
my smell of the salt water
and ready access to all the mud I want to roll in!"

line 2086:  the boardwalk buildings

line 2087:  The far side of the Tramp Boardwalk is lined
with tawdry, tacky tourist traps.
A bit of blue sky peeks through the buildings.

You wonder why this place doesn't join in the celebration
of Donald Tramp's birthday.

line 167:  "Hiya, Cutie!" says the older woman behind the
counter.
"Welcome to `Skates, Etc.'
I'm your hostess for your visit, Ivana Tramp."

line 202:  "Hello," you say. "I'd like to rent some skates."

line 205:  "Good idea; you've come to the right place.
My rental fee is quite reasonable,
but there's no use quibbling over such details now.
When you return the skates, we'll settle up based
upon the number of minutes you actually skate."

line 215:  "But, first, I'll need a small deposit
for such valuable equipment.
Let's say (sizing you up), oh, $%d, okay?"

line 226:  "I don't have any money," you say.

line 229:  "Oh? Well, I suppose I'll accept some more of
those damned `silver dollars' from the casino."

line 247:  "You have an inspiration.
"Instead of money, would you accept
this "auto-focus, auto-level, auto-color balance,
auto-zoom, auto-pan, .5-lux,
Complete-Video-Studio-in-a-Pocket-Protector?"
It's called `The Rob Lowe Model,' you know!"

line 255:  "It's the very latest model and was very
expensive," you continue.
"But you've got to promise to give it
back when I return your skates."

line 262:  "Hmmmm," she muses,
"`The Rob Lowe Model?'
Yeah, I suppose that'll do for a deposit."

line 270:  And she takes it from you.

line 286:  "Here's my skates, ma'am," you say,
handing them across the counter.
"May I have my deposit back now?"

line 291:  "Well, I dunno," she hesitates.
"First, lemme inspect 'em for damages."
And she diligently inspects every inch of your skates.

line 303:  "Hey, looky here!
Ya scuffed this wheel!" she shrieks.
"I'm gonna haf'ta dock yer refund %d bucks!"

line 317:  "Hmmm. Well there's a small nick in this
one wheel,
but I guess you can have your camcorder back
anyway, although I was kinda hopin' you'd jes'
keep the skates."

line 352:  Ivana Tramp (known locally as "Wheels, The Blademaster")
has plummeted several social levels since her divorce
from The Donald.

line 364:  There's no need to shove her around, Larry;
she's been shoved enough already!

them blades, my little `Chicken Fat?'" says Ivana.

"Remember: `keep your tips up!'"

We'll settle up when you return the skates!"

but I never accept tips!"

line 437:  Would you be willing to settle for
$%d.00?" you ask.
"That's all the money I have!

line 443:  "Hardly," she sniffs.
"But, do you have anything else of value?"

line 449:  "Here you are," you say,
"here's %d of those heavy silver dollars."

line 456:  "Thank you, sir!" she replies,
accepting your money.
"And remember: keep your skates as long as
you wish; enjoy them as you would any other
fine mechanical object.
Just don't wear them off the boardwalk,
for any reason."

line 476:  "Oh, no," says Ivana Tramp.
"that's yours! But, thanks anyway."

line 482:  "Yes? Isn't that cute?" says Ivana.
"You've got your skates.
Why are you showing that to me?"

line 499:  "What's the matter, little buddy?"
asks Ivana. "Are you afraid you'll go outside
on the boardwalk and get `stuck in a crack?'"

line 533:  the skates

line 534:  From the many pairs of in-line skates on this rack,
you feel safe in predicting that this store rents skates.

line 541:  You can't reach the skates, but even if you
could, the owner would break your finger if you tried to
take them without paying.

you really have no desire to carry it with you throughout
the rest of the game.

line 746:  Ivana

line 796:  There's no place here to sit down-- except
that dirty box which might very well soil your

line 561:  This shelf contains a lot of electronic equipment,
most of it old, plus a shelf filled with blank
reel-to-reel tapes.

line 579:  the rack filled with blank tapes

line 580:  Why, here's what you need!
A rack filled with blank, reel-to-reel recording tapes.

line 588:  You have no use for another tape.
Use the one you have!

line 647:  the microphone mixer

line 655:  Before you lies an elaborate microphone mixer and
studio control panel console.
The names of the various downstairs studios are
engraved on the potentiometers.

line 661:  This volume control says, "Studio D."

line 664:  This potentiometer says, "Studio C."

line 667:  This slider says, "Control Room B."

line 670:  This pot is labeled, "Studio A."

line 673:  The rest of these are labeled "Carts (A-F),"
"Tables (A-C)," "CDs (A-R)."

line 680:  The console contains many knobs, sliders,
meters and buttons.
Which one will you choose?

line 706:  the microphone

line 707:  A professional-quality, high-fidelity, studio ribbon
microphone hangs from a boom over the studio console.

line 714:  You carefully aim the microphone so it's pointing
just below your mouth.

line 722:  You hear your voice echo through the room's
moniter speakers.
The speakers are amazingly loud;
loud enough to break glass.

line 728:  You carefully check the level of your voice on the
mixer. It's okay.

line 750:  the reel-to-reel tape recorder

line 771:  What's the use of recording silence?
There no signal currently being fed to this deck.

line 777:  The recorder's automatic shut-off prevents it
from operating without a properly mounted tape.

line 785:  The recorder is capturing every nuance of
"2 Live 2 Screw's" conversation.

line 791:  The recorder contains a tape full of
incriminating evidence.

line 795:  This tape is half on the take-up reel.
It needs to be rewound before you can remove it
from the recorder.

line 800:  There is a blank tape on the recorder.

line 805:  A large Studer console recorder is all
warmed up and ready to record--except there's
no tape upon which to record!

line 816:  Your tape is already recorded.

line 843:  the tape

line 844:  A large Studer console recorder is all warmed up and
ready to record -- except there's no tape upon which
to record!

line 859:  P. C. Hammer

line 860:  P. C. Hammer is working in the next Control Room.

line 873:  the glass window

line 874:  A heavy, soundproof, plate-glass window separates you
from the outside--and your freedom!

line 890:  the microphone mixer

line 943:  Taking your biggest possible diaphragmatic breath,
you lean back and belt out your most powerful high C,
directly into the microphone, through the powerful amplifiers
and out through the control room monitor speakers!

line 960:  Is it Patti...

line 961:  ...or is it Memorex?

line 1014:  Punching in the access code you learned by watching
P. C. Hammer, you are able to ride the showervator back
to John Krapper's bathroom.
Luckily, no one noticed your clothes lying on the
floor there.

line 1022:  Putting on your dress and gathering your possessions,
you sneak back to the receptionist's lobby door and wait
for her to take a break before making for the safety of
your patiently waiting limo.

line 1074:  You grab a blank reel of tape from the rack.

line 1104:  You turn on the reel-to-reel tape recorder.

line 1109:  As you record "2 Live 2 Screw,"
you giggle with delight as they thoroughly
incriminate themselves.

line 1121:  What's that? What's P. C. Hammer doing?
He looks like he's seen your "Recording" sign!
And he doesn't look too happy about it.

line 1134:  Oh, oh! Where did Hammer go?

line 1175:  You turn off the recorder.

line 1215:  The tape is now fully rewound.

line 1260:  You remove the reel-to-reel tape.

line 1296:  You bring up the volume control labeled
"Studio D."

line 1299:  You hear nothing but hiss.

line 1302:  You bring up the potentiometer labeled
"Studio C."

line 1305:  You hear nothing but hiss and a little
air conditioner bleed-through.

line 1309:  You pull up the slider labeled "Control Room B"
and hear what sounds like a female breathing.

line 1312:  (Oh, wait! That's you!
You're in Control Room B!)

line 1321:  Since you've cranked it up to the point
of feedback, you can't go any louder!
Besides, it's almost loud enough to
break glass.

line 1326:  You crank up the volume on your control
room's monitor speakers to an
ear-piercing level.

line 1332:  You are eavesdropping on the conversations
from Studio A and to you it sounds just like
"2 Live 2 Screw!"

line 1352:  You fade up the volume on "Studio A" and...
listen to that!

line 1358:  Why, that's "2 Live 2 Screw!" Patti! You did it!
Now you can overhear their conversation!

line 1364:  But how can you bring back evidence to
prove what you are hearing!?

line 1405:  You place your tape on the recorder,
carefully threading it around the tension arms,
over the heads and past the capstan,
finishing by treading the leader onto the takeup reel
with a professional flourish.

line 1429:  the Control Room A door

line 1430:  Be careful, Patti! Inside that door stands the man
you've come here to investigate: P. C. Hammer!

line 1440:  You don't want to try that door, Patti!
The direct approach won't work with P. C. Hammer.

line 1461:  the Control Room B door

line 1462:  A sign on the door reads "Control Room B."
It is currently unoccupied.

line 1479:  P. C. Hammer

line 1480:  Through the control room window,
you see P. C. Hammer mixing his "live" radio broadcast
for tomorrow morning's drive time show.

line 1493:  the microphone stand

line 1494:  A large boom microphone stand sits just outside
the door to Control Room B.

line 1507:  the recording sign

line 1508:  This sign is illuminated whenever anyone is recording
inside this control room.

line 1519:  You attempt to hike up those Hammerpants you're wearing,
but it does no good!

line 1524:  Maintaining your cool,
you surreptitiously check the zipper on your giant baggy pants.
It's fine.

is dental equipment and a lot of people wearing smocks!

line 164:  A closed gymnastics studio is on the ground floor,
while a dentist's office occupies the second floor.

line 215:  the palm trees

line 216:  Miami is filled with exotic palm trees just like these.

line 231:  the gymnastics studio

line 239:  It looks like there is no one inside the gymnastics
studio, although the mini-blinds severely handicap your view.

line 243:  You are unable to part the mini-blinds to see inside
since the blinds are commonly placed on the INSIDE of
the glass!

Immediately below it is a closed gymnastics studio,
"The Gym-Dandy Gymnastics Center."

line 358:  Carefully inspecting the sidewalk,
you conclude Doc Pulliam doesn't spend much on
filling cavities out here!

perfunctory building.

line 393:  the gymnastic studio sign

Get out of your car and cut off your slaussen.
Get back in your car and continue on until you reach
the Beach Front Highway. Take the Beach Front Highway
to 22nd Street Southwest and stop when you come
to the giant revolving tooth!

line 98:  You are inside the waiting room of Doc Pulliam's Dental
Hygiene Heaven.
You love the carpet motif;
in fact, you feel sure you seen something a lot like
it before... somewhere.

line 212:  There is nothing you need to do there.

line 227:  Your teeth feel so clean
you won't need to floss for a month!

line 247:  You would be too embarrassed to walk outside
with that silly doily wrapped around your head.

line 276:  the magazines

line 277:  After glancing at a few of the magazines,
you decide you have no interest in learning
what the stock market will do in 1969!

line 289:  Being totally bored with the AeroDork In-Flight
Magazine, you shove it into Doc's magazine rack,
where it is sure to delight and amaze his primarily
Spanish-speaking customers.

line 318:  the palm

line 319:  You wonder if that palm tree will ever require a
"root canal?"

line 328:  The palm tree feels rough to your touch.

line 382:  You've always been a big fan of the

"String and Doorknob" dentistry.
And where exactly is the "School of Hard Knockers?"

line 414:  the table

line 415:  You can tell that Doc's wife decorated this place.
She's suffering from terminal cuteness!

line 432:  the chair

line 433:  This chair looks just right!

line 459:  the chair

line 460:  This chair looks too hard.

line 541:  There's nothing left on this table
since you took Doc's doily!

line 544:  The only thing on this table is a long, lacy doily.
It reminds you of those long runners your Grandmother
had on her table.

line 552:  You've already taken the doily.
You have no use for the table.

line 592:  the receptionist

line 593:  You thought this might be the babe you've

Not even you could consider this one sexy

"Would you please send my limousine over to
Doc Pulliam's right away?"

line 901:  "No, I'm sorry, Mr. Laffer.
All of our drivers are on break right now.
Could you call back again in a few minutes?"

line 908:  "Why, yes sir, Mr. Laffer.
In fact, one of our drivers is in that vicinity
right now.
Just look outside.
I bet you'll see her!"

line 916:  "You again?
Why don't you just go outside and get it?!
She's waiting for you!"

line 927:  "Good afternoon.
You've reached Dr. Pulliam's exchange.
I'm sorry, but everyone in their office has
gone home for the evening.
But please feel free to call back tomorrow.

This is, uh, umm, ah, Dr. `Payne.'
I'm going to have to send over one of my
emergency patients over for Doc Pulliam.
Something's come up and I won't be able to see
him this afternoon.
Could you please see him right away?
Thanks ever so much.
Gotta go; it's tee time!"

line 953:  You already did that.

line 957:  You change your mind and hang up the phone.

line 960:  Hmmm. Wrong number.

line 961:  "Now where did I put that telephone number?"
you ask yourself.

line 987:  the sliding glass window

line 997:  First, hang up the phone.

line 1003:  There is no answer from beyond the sliding
glass windows.
Either they're avoiding you or they've all gone home.

line 1015:  "Go away," a voice cries through the glass.
"You already have an appointment.
We'll see you then!"

line 1024:  Ghostly shapes seem to float on the other side of a
set of frosted sliding glass windows.
There must be someone working back there.
On the window a small Dymo label reads,
"Knock on window for service."

line 1032:  Doc's office is already full of Doc's business cards.

line 1048:  the door

line 1049:  This door leads to the inner offices of Doc Pulliam,
including (you hope) the cubicle of Chi Chi Lambada,
the woman you traveled all this way to "interview."

line 1141:  You rap your knuckles gently on the textured
sliding glass window.

line 1167:  "Oh," she growls, "and
just what do we think we're doing here,
eh, little man?"

line 1175:  "Yeah, what is it?"

line 1191:  "Hello," you say in your most pleasant tone,
"my name is Larry; Larry Laffer.
I wonder if I might get an appointment with one of your
dental hygienists?"

line 1198:  "Hello," you say to the receptionist.
"I'd like an appointment to see one of your
dental hygienists.
I think I'm due for a little oral cavity work
(if you know what I mean)."

line 1212:  "No!" she says, closing the window.

line 1220:  "Yeah, maybe," she replies,
"but first, let's do your paperwork."

line 1240:  "Wait!" you cry, but it's too late.

line 1250:  And she grabs a large piece of paper,
covered with tiny type.

line 1255:  "Okay, sweetie,
let's fill out this lil' ol' admission form together,
now shall we?"

line 1264:  Question #%d

line 1415:  "Oops! Well, gosh, I'm sorry,

I just remembered...

Why, just go right on in.

line 1461:  "Excuse me, ma'am," you say, hoping she
doesn't recognize your voice.
"My name is Larry; Larry Laffer."

line 1465:  "Well, Larry, that was a quick trip!
Please, just walk through the door to the right!
I'll have one of our technicians attend to you
right away!"

line 1516:  the doily

line 1527:  The only thing on this table is a long, lacy doily.
It reminds you of those long runners your Grandmother
had on her table.

but you really don't know why.

Chi Chi Lambada is the perfect name for this Latin beauty!

line 128:  Chi Chi Lambada's Dental Hygiene Heaven cubicle

Instead of Muzak, hot salsa music plays over a powerful
stereo system.
And how strange: the center of the carpet shows signs
of extensive wear.

line 142:  "You know, Chi Chi, 
I bet a girl like you could use something like this," 
you say, offering her the green card you "found"

"Oh, Larry!
You've made me the happiest woman in Miami.

Broadcasting even HAD a dental college!

Chi Chi asks you a question.

occasionally rub up against your elbow... like this.
Sometimes when I hear that salsa music,
I get so excited I just can't control myself!"

"Are you an `undocumented worker?'"

line 720:  "Yes, I guess I am," she replies.
"Although I'd do anything for the man who could help 
me become a citizen."

line 731:  "Say," she pauses and looks deep into your eyes,
"you wouldn't have any ideas about this, would you?"

line 741:  "Uh, no, I can't think of anything right now,"
you say with a grin.
"But if something pops up, I feel certain I'll think of you!"

line 42:  "Where am I?" you wonder.
"What's happened to me?
What am I doing here?"

line 45:  The last you remember,
you were writing your life story as a computer game,
sitting on a deck with a half-naked woman,
overlooking a beautiful lake nestled
high in the Sierra Nevada.

line 53:  "I remember a woman named Patti;
something about an island;
and, a gig as a computer game programmer?" you think.
"What's going on?"

line 57:  "How did I end up in Hollywood --
and what am I supposed to be doing here?" you sigh.
"I'm so confused!"

line 60:  (Of course, you're quite accustomed
to being confused!)

line 65:  "And what am I doing in Larry 5?" you think.
"And whatever happened to Larry 4?"

line 67:  Slowly you come to the realization that you
must be suffering from amnesia,
although how a computer game character gets
amnesia you do not understand!

line 74:  "Who was that Patti woman?
Does she still exist?
Did she ever exist?" you think.
"Or is she just a series of partially-toggled bits
in my memories?"

line 79:  You remember her most deeply in your heart,
not to mention several other major organs.

line 81:  But where is she?
Will you see her again?
Does she ever think of you?

line 87:  Suddenly, your memories stir again,
"Patti was Passionate Patti, the famous pianist/entertainer.
I remember: I loved her!"

line 90:  "And wait! She loved me, too!
Will I ever find her again?"
