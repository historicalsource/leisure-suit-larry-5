PC's recording sign should always be lit; Patti's should only be lit
when she's recording (ie, in 890). 


Work with AL on the tape recorder sequence.  Here are a few bugs you may
want to fix before your next performance review:
	the feature on the reel-to-reel recorder is too tight;
	the pic still has the reel in it; 
	you can't record talking if you haven't turned on the console; 
	remove the piece of pic from the shot outside the room (2nd pic in 890); 
	add complete verbs to the microphone, the tapes, the recorder,
		the console;
	exit through the window, not behind the console;
	fix PC Hammer's stepSize
