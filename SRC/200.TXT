Carlos:  What I really wanted to happen here:
						((and (Btst pfGotInfoRB)
								(Btst pfGotInfoPC))
							(TPrint "xxx You already have the information you need,
								Patti!")
							(++ state)
							(= cycles 2)
						)
was this:
(TPrint "You dial Inspector Desmond's office.")
(TPrint "\"Hello, Desmond here!\"")
(TPrint "\"Inspector, this is Patti, calling from the limo cell phone.\"")
(TPrint "\"Oh, hi, Patti? Everything going alright?\"")
(TPrint "\"Oh, yes, Inspector! Just thought I'd tell you where I was.\"")
(TPrint "\"You're just like everyone who gets a cell phone,\" he laughs,
	\"you always call to say you're using it!
	Don't run up the company bill too much, OK?\"")
(TPrint "\"Okay, Inspector Desmond.  See you later.\"")
(TPrint "\"Bye, Patti. And... good luck!\"")
